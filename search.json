函数定义\n- 返回类型（return_type）：一个函数可以返回一个值。return_type 是函数返回的值的数据类型。有些函数执行所需的操作而不返回值，在这种情况下，return_type 是关键字 void。\n- 函数名称(function_name)：这是函数的实际名称。函数名和参数列表一起构成了函数签名。\n- 参数(parameter list)：参数就像是占位符。当函数被调用时，您向参数传递一个值，这个值被称为实际参数。参数列表包括函数参数的类型、顺序、数量。参数是可选的，也就是说，函数可能不包含参数。\n- 函数主体(body of the function)：函数主体包含一组定义函数执行任务的语句。\n```\nreturn_type function_name( parameter list )\n{\n   body of the function\n}\n// 函数定义 \n\nreturn_type function_name( parameter list );\n//函数声明。函数声明会告诉编译器函数名称及如何调用函数。\n\n```\n\n#### 函数调用\n- 当您在一个源文件中定义函数且在另一个文件中调用函数时，函数声明是必需的。在这种情况下，您应该在调用函数的文件顶部声明函数。\n- 当程序调用函数时，程序控制权会转移给被调用的函数。被调用的函数执行已定义的任务，当函数的返回语句被执行时，或到达函数的结束括号时，会把程序控制权交还给主程序。\n- 当调用函数时，有两种向函数传递参数的方式:\n\n调用类型 | 描述\n- | -\n传值调用 | 该方法把参数的实际值复制给函数的形式参数。在这种情况下，修改函数内的形式参数不会影响实际参数。\n引用调用 | 通过指针传递方式，形参为指向实参地址的指针，当对形参的指向操作时，就相当于对实参本身进行的操作。\n\n> 默认情况下，C 使用传值调用来传递参数。一般来说，这意味着函数内的代码不能改变用于调用函数的实际参数。\n> （个人经验）如果在被调用函数创建数组（非通过malloc堆方式），调用函数是无法访问的该数组的！如果想访问该数组：\n> 1是直接通过malloc这类堆形式创建。\n> 2是通过static变量（这类变量能保留到程序结束。）\n\n### （2）局部变量和全局变量\n任何一种编程中，作用域是程序中定义的变量所存在的区域，超过该区域变量就不能被访问。C 语言中有三个地方可以声明变量：\n- 在函数或块内部的局部变量\n- 在所有函数外部的全局变量\n- 在形式参数的函数参数定义中\n\n全局变量与局部变量在内存中的区别：\n\n- 全局变量保存在内存的全局存储区中，占用静态的存储单元；\n- 局部变量保存在栈中，只有在所在函数被调用时才动态地为变量分配存储单元。\n\n> 在程序中，局部变量和全局变量的名称可以相同，但是在函数内，如果两个名字相同，会使用局部变量值，全局变量不会被使用。\n> 函数的参数，形式参数，被当作该函数内的局部变量，如果与全局变量同名它们会优先使用。\n> 当局部变量被定义时，系统不会对其初始化，您必须自行对其初始化。定义全局变量时，系统会自动对其初始化。\n\n数据类型 | 初始化默认值\n- | -\nint | 0\nchar | '\\0'\nfloat | 0\ndouble | 0\npointer | NULL\n\n### （3）变量的存储类型\n```\n    auto int month;//auto使用方法\n\n    register int  miles;//register使用方法\n    \n    static int thingy = 5;//static使用方法\n\n// extern使用方法\n//第一个文件：main.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n \nint count ;\nextern void write_extern();\n \nint main()\n{\n   count = 5;\n   write_extern();\n}\n\n//第二个文件：support.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n \nextern int count;\n \nvoid write_extern(void)\n{\n   printf(\"count is %d\\n\", count);\n}\n\n//结果：count is 5\n```\n\n#### auto 存储类\n- auto 存储类是所有局部变量默认的存储类。\n\n#### register 存储类（建议存放在寄存器）\n- register 存储类用于定义存储在寄存器中而不是 RAM 中的局部变量。这意味着变量的最大尺寸等于寄存器的大小（通常是一个词），且不能对它应用一元的 '&' 运算符（因为它没有内存位置）。\n- 寄存器只用于需要快速访问的变量，比如计数器。还应注意的是，定义 'register' 并不意味着变量将被存储在寄存器中，它意味着变量可能存储在寄存器中，这取决于硬件和实现的限制。\n\n#### static 存储类\n两个作用：\n- static 存储类指示编译器在程序的生命周期内保持局部变量的存在，而不需要在每次它进入和离开作用域时进行创建和销毁。因此，使用 static 修饰局部变量可以在函数调用之间保持局部变量的值。\n- static 修饰符也可以应用于全局变量。当 static 修饰全局变量时，会使变量的作用域限制在声明它的文件内。\n\n#### extern 存储类（函数 or 变量）\n- extern 存储类用于提供一个全局变量的引用，全局变量对所有的程序文件都是可见的。当您使用 extern 时，对于无法初始化的变量，会把变量名指向一个之前定义过的存储位置。\n- 当您有多个文件且定义了一个可以在其他文件中使用的全局变量或函数时，可以在其他文件中使用 extern 来得到已定义的变量或函数的引用。可以这么理解，extern 是用来在另一个文件中声明一个全局变量或函数。\n\n### （4）内部函数与外部函数\n- 内部函数：函数仅能被本文件中其他函数所调用称为内部函数；需要在函数前面加static；\n- 外部函数：函数可以被工程中的其他文件函数调用称为外部函数；当工程其他文件需要调用外部函数时，申明中要加extern，当然也可以省略，因为函数本质是外部的。\n- [详情请点这里](https://blog.csdn.net/nangeali/article/details/78834998)\n\n## 5、指针\n### （1）地址和指针的概念\n> 每一个变量都有一个内存位置，每一个内存位置都定义了可使用连字号（&）运算符访问的地址，它表示了在内存中的一个地址。\n> 指针是一个变量，其值为另一个变量的地址，即，内存位置的直接地址。\n> 不同数据类型的指针之间唯一的不同是，指针所指向的变量或常量的数据类型不同。\n```\ntype *var-name;\n//type 是指针的基类型，它必须是一个有效的 C 数据类型，\n//var-name 是指针变量的名称。\n//用来声明指针的星号 * 与乘法中使用的星号是相同的。\n```\n\n### （2）数组的指针和指向数组的指针变量\n- 数组名是一个指向数组中第一个元素的常量指针。\n```\ndouble *p;\ndouble balance[10];//定义\np = balance;//赋值\n\n```\n- 使用数组名作为常量指针是合法的，反之亦然。因此，*(balance + 4) 是一种访问 balance[4] 数据的合法方式。\n- 一旦您把第一个元素的地址存储在 p 中，您就可以使用 *p、*(p+1)、*(p+2) 等来访问数组元素。\n\n### （3）字符串的指针和指向字符串的指针变量\n- 这个我真的不知道哪里找资料了。。。\n- 具体跟一维数组其实是一样的。也没啥\n\n### （4）函数的指针和指向函数的指针变量\n- 函数指针是指向函数的指针变量。\n- 通常我们说的指针变量是指向一个整型、字符型或数组等变量，而函数指针是指向函数。\n- 函数指针可以像一般函数一样，用于调用函数、传递参数。\n函数指针变量的声明：\n```\ntypedef int (*fun_ptr)(int,int); // 声明一个指向同样参数、返回值的函数指针类型\n\nint (* p)(int, int) = & max; // &可以省略\n```\n函数指针变量可以作为某个函数的参数来使用的，回调函数就是一个通过函数指针调用的函数。\n简单讲：回调函数是由别人的函数执行时调用你实现的函数。\n\n### （5）指针数组和指向指针的数组\n指针数组和数组指针的区别\n指针数组：指针数组可以说成是”指针的数组”，首先这个变量是一个数组。\n- 其次，”指针”修饰这个数组，意思是说这个数组的所有元素都是指针类型。\n- 在 32 位系统中，指针占四个字节。\n\n数组指针：数组指针可以说成是”数组的指针”，首先这个变量是一个指针。\n- 其次，”数组”修饰这个指针，意思是说这个指针存放着一个数组的首地址，或者说这个指针指向一个数组的首地址。\n\n## 6、结构体和共同体\n### （1）结构体变量的定义和使用方法（位段）\n```\nstruct tag { \n    member-list\n    member-list \n    member-list  \n    ...\n} variable-list ;\n```\n- tag 是结构体标签。\n- member-list 是标准的变量定义，比如 int i; 或者 float f，或者其他有效的变量定义。\n- variable-list 结构变量，定义在结构的末尾，最后一个分号之前，您可以指定一个或多个结构变量。\n```\n//此声明声明了拥有3个成员的结构体，分别为整型的a，字符型的b和双精度的c\n//同时又声明了结构体变量s1\n//这个结构体并没有标明其标签\nstruct \n{\n    int a;\n    char b;\n    double c;\n} s1;\n \n//此声明声明了拥有3个成员的结构体，分别为整型的a，字符型的b和双精度的c\n//结构体的标签被命名为SIMPLE,没有声明变量\nstruct SIMPLE\n{\n    int a;\n    char b;\n    double c;\n};\n\n//用SIMPLE标签的结构体，另外声明了变量t1、t2、t3\nstruct SIMPLE t1, t2[20], *t3;\n \n//也可以用typedef创建新类型\ntypedef struct\n{\n    int a;\n    char b;\n    double c; \n} Simple2;\n//现在可以用Simple2作为类型声明新的结构体变量\nSimple2 u1, u2[20], *u3;\n\n//此结构体的声明包含了其他的结构体\nstruct COMPLEX\n{\n    char string[100];\n    struct SIMPLE a;\n};\n \n//此结构体的声明包含了指向自己类型的指针\nstruct NODE\n{\n    char string[100];\n    struct NODE *next_node;\n}\n\nstruct B;    //对结构体B进行不完整声明\n \n//结构体A中包含指向结构体B的指针\nstruct A\n{\n    struct B *partner;\n    //other members;\n};\n \n//结构体B中包含指向结构体A的指针，在A声明完后，B也随之进行声明\nstruct B\n{\n    struct A *partner;\n    //other members;\n};\n\n/* 函数声明 */\nvoid printBook( struct Books book );\n```\n\n### （2）指向结构体类型变量的指针\n```\nstruct Books *struct_pointer;\n\n/* 函数声明 */\nvoid printBook( struct Books *book );\n```\n\n### （3）用指针处理链表\n- 参考《数据结构》\n\n### （4）共同体变量的定义和使用方法\n```\n//定义\nunion [union tag]//union tag 是可选的\n{\n   member definition;\n   member definition;\n   ...\n   member definition;\n} [one or more union variables];\n\n//例子\nunion Data\n{\n   int i;\n   float f;\n   char  str[20];\n};\n   union Data data;\n   data.i = 10;\n```\n- 共用体占用的内存应足够存储共用体中最大的成员。\n\n### （5）枚举类型\n- 注意：第一个枚举成员的默认值为整型的 0，后续枚举成员的值在前一个成员上加 1。我们在这个实例中把第一个枚举成员的值定义为 1，第二个就为 2，以此类推。\n\n```\n//定义\nenum　枚举名　{枚举元素1,枚举元素2,……};\nenum DAY\n{\n      MON=1, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN\n};\n\n//1、先定义枚举类型，再定义枚举变量\n\nenum DAY\n{\n      MON=1, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN\n};\nenum DAY day;\n//2、定义枚举类型的同时定义枚举变量\n\nenum DAY\n{\n      MON=1, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN\n} day;\n//3、省略枚举名称，直接定义枚举变量\n\nenum\n{\n      MON=1, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN\n} day;\n```\n\n## 7、位运算\n### （1）位运算符和位运算\n- 上面有\n### （2）位段\n- 这种结构需要 8 字节的内存空间，但在实际上，在每个变量中，我们只存储 0 或 1。在这种情况下，C 语言提供了一种更好的利用内存空间的方式。如果您在结构内使用这样的变量，您可以定义变量的宽度来告诉编译器，您将只使用这些字节。\n- 无名位域一般用来作填充或者调整成员位置。因为没有名称，无名位域不能使用。\n```\nstruct\n{\n  type [member_name] : width ;\n};\n\n//具体例子\nstruct\n{\n  unsigned int age : 3;\n} Age;\n\nAge.age = 7;//使用方案\n\nAge.age = 8;// 二进制表示为 1000 有四位，超出\n```\n元素 | 描述\n- | -  \ntype | 整数类型，决定了如何解释位域的值。类型可以是整型、有符号整型、无符号整型。\nmember_name | 位域的名称。\nwidth | 位域中位的数量。宽度必须小于或等于指定类型的位宽度。\n\n## 8、文件\n### （1）文件类型指针\n- FILE *f;\n\n### （2）文件操作，包括打开、关闭、读写和定位等。\n#### 打开文件\n您可以使用 fopen( ) 函数来创建一个新的文件或者打开一个已有的文件，这个调用会初始化类型 FILE 的一个对象，类型 FILE 包含了所有用来控制流的必要的信息。下面是这个函数调用的原型：\n```\nFILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );\n```\n在这里，filename 是字符串，用来命名文件，访问模式 mode 的值可以是下列值中的一个：\n\n模式 | 描述\n- | -\nr | 打开一个已有的文本文件，允许读取文件。\nw | 打开一个文本文件，允许写入文件。如果文件不存在，则会创建一个新文件。在这里，您的程序会从文件的开头写入内容。如果文件存在，则该会被截断为零长度，重新写入。\na | 打开一个文本文件，以追加模式写入文件。如果文件不存在，则会创建一个新文件。在这里，您的程序会在已有的文件内容中追加内容。\nr+ | 打开一个文本文件，允许读写文件。\nw+ | 打开一个文本文件，允许读写文件。如果文件已存在，则文件会被截断为零长度，如果文件不存在，则会创建一个新文件。\na+ | 打开一个文本文件，允许读写文件。如果文件不存在，则会创建一个新文件。读取会从文件的开头开始，写入则只能是追加模式。\n\n如果处理的是二进制文件，则需使用下面的访问模式来取代上面的访问模式：\n- \"rb\", \"wb\", \"ab\", \"rb+\", \"r+b\", \"wb+\", \"w+b\", \"ab+\", \"a+b\"\n\n#### 关闭文件\n为了关闭文件，请使用 fclose( ) 函数。函数的原型如下：\n```\nint fclose( FILE *fp );\n```\n- 如果成功关闭文件，fclose( ) 函数返回零，如果关闭文件时发生错误，函数返回 EOF。这个函数实际上，会清空缓冲区中的数据，关闭文件，并释放用于该文件的所有内存。EOF 是一个定义在头文件 stdio.h 中的常量。\n\n#### 写入文件\n```\nint fputc( int c, FILE *fp );//字符\n\nint fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp );//字符串\n\n int fprintf(FILE *fp,const char *format, ...);//字符串\n```\n- 函数 fputc() 把参数 c 的字符值写入到 fp 所指向的输出流中。如果写入成功，它会返回写入的字符，如果发生错误，则会返回 EOF。\n- 函数 fputs() 把字符串 s 写入到 fp 所指向的输出流中。如果写入成功，它会返回一个非负值，如果发生错误，则会返回 EOF。您也可以使用fprintf函数来写把一个字符串写入到文件中。\n\n#### 读取文件\n```\nint fgetc( FILE * fp );//字符\nchar *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );//字符串 遇换行符与EOF结束\nint fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format, ...);//字符串 遇空格结束\n```\n- fgetc() 函数从 fp 所指向的输入文件中读取一个字符。返回值是读取的字符，如果发生错误则返回 EOF。\n- 函数 fgets() 从 fp 所指向的输入流中读取 n - 1 个字符。它会把读取的字符串复制到缓冲区 buf，并在最后追加一个 null 字符来终止字符串。\n如果这个函数在读取最后一个字符之前就遇到一个换行符 '\\n' 或文件的末尾 EOF，则只会返回读取到的字符，包括换行符。您也可以使用fscanf函数来从文件中读取字符串，但是在遇到第一个空格字符时，它会停止读取。\n\n#### 定位文件\n##### fseek函数：\n能把文件指针移动到文件任何位置，其原型是：int fseek(FILE *fp, long offset, int fromwhere);\n- 参数解释：第一个参数为要进行定位的文件的指针；第二个参数为定位的偏移量，一个有符号的long类型值，正数表示文件指针向后偏移，负数表示文件指针向前偏移，0 表示不进行偏移；第三个参数表示文件指针从哪个位置开始偏移，有三个值可选，SEEK_SET & SEEK_CUR & SEEK_END，分别表示文件第一个字节（即第零个位置），文件指针当前所指字节（即当前位置）和文件EOF位置。\n- 返回值：返回 0 表示操作成功，返回非 0 表示操作失败。\n- 其他注意：该函数不能定位到第一个字节之前的位置，如果尝试这样操作会导致fseek返回 -1，即操作失败，比如这样的代码“j = fseek(fp, -4L, SEEK_SET );”，其中 j 值就是 -1；但是，该函数能定位到EOF位置之后的位置，并且不报错，即使这样是没有意义的，比如这样的代码“j = fseek(fp, 4L, SEEK_END)”，返回值 j 是 0，并且此时 ftell(fp) 返回值是SEEK_END + 4。\n\n##### ftell函数：\n能返回当前文件指针所在的位置（文件的第一个字节所在位置是零），其原型是：long ftell(FILE *fp);\n- 参数解释：有且仅有一个参数，为一个文件的指针。\n- 返回值：有符号long类型的正向值，即0~2147483647。\n- 其他注意：暂无。\n\n> 实际上，前两个函数对文件指针的定位虽然都很方便，但是它们都有一个局限性，那就是它们能定位的最大字节是依据 long 类型的取值范围决定。比如 fseek(fp, max_pos, SEEK_SET);，它能移动的最大偏移量是 max_pos = 2147483647字节，即1GB，对于大于1GB的文件来说就力不从心了。\n\n# 参考链接：\n- [菜鸟教程](https://www.runoob.com/cprogramming/c-tutorial.html)\n-

[传送门](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av53306170?from=search&seid=4397539768243415833)\n## wiki定义：\n- RSS（最初是RDF网站摘要；后来出现了两种相互竞争的方法，分别使用了反义词 Rich Site Summary和Really Simple Syndication）[2]是一种Web feed [3]，允许用户和应用程序访问网站中的更新标准化的计算机可读格式。这些提要例如可以允许用户在单个新闻聚合器中跟踪许多不同的网站。新闻聚合器将自动检查RSS提要中是否有新内容，从而使内容可以自动从网站传递到网站或从网站传递给用户。内容的这种传递称为网络联合。网站通常使用RSS feed来发布经常更新的信息，例如博客条目，新闻标题或音频和视频系列剧集。RSS还用于分发播客。RSS文档（称为“提要”，“网络提要”，[4]或“频道”）包括完整或摘要的文本以及元数据，例如发布日期和作者姓名。\n\n- 标准的XML文件格式可确保与许多不同的机器/程序兼容。RSS feed也使希望从喜爱的网站及时接收更新或从许多网站汇总数据的用户受益。\n\n- 订阅网站RSS使用户无需手动检查网站是否有新内容。取而代之的是，他们的浏览器会不断监视该站点，并通知用户任何更新。还可以命令浏览器为用户自动下载新数据。\n\n- RSS feed数据使用称为新闻聚合器的软件呈现给用户。该聚合器可以内置到网站中，安装在台式计算机上或安装在移动设备上。用户可以通过在阅读器中输入提要的URI或单击浏览器的提要图标来订阅提要。RSS阅读器会定期检查用户的提要中是否有新信息，如果启用了该功能，则可以自动下载。阅读器还提供了一个用户界面。\n\n## 我的总结：\n- RSS是一种格式，标准。\n- 使用RSS的协议可以做成一个新闻聚合器，新闻提醒器，把你想要的新闻聚合起来并提醒且提供给你。\n\n# 能干嘛？\n- 能做为信息聚合，只看你想看的信息，能信息提醒，每天信息更新，你想看的信息会自动获取给你。\n\n# 怎能做到的？\n- 步骤分三步，分别对应三种工具。\n- 下面我会一一介绍原理并介绍我使用的工具。\n## 信息包装——包装工具\n- 有些网站会提供支持RSS协议的阅读源（支持的话直接使用就行了），有些则不行。这个时候就需要将信息进行打包的工具。\n### rsshub —— 万物皆可 RSS\n- [传送门](https://docs.rsshub.app/)\n- 这个工具使得RSS国内资源的获取曲线变得普通人都可以使用了。\n- 直接阅读文档即可使用。\n\n### feed43 —— 学会几乎所有网站皆可RSS（需安全代理/科学上网）\n- 一个视频教程[传送门](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av31361577?from=search&seid=4397539768243415833)\n- 这个工具是rsshub没有资源，比如本人学校网站啊这类的。就可以自己搞一个使用。\n## 信息提取——网站\n- 制作完RSS源之后直接把链接复制到订阅源订阅就完事了。等待网站自己去获取信息。这类网站有很多个。我就推荐三个。\n\n### inoreader \n- 一开始大学老师介绍的都挺详细的了。\n- 有广告。（这点让我放弃了它。）\n\n### ttrss\n- 这个是要自己搭建网站使用的。界面很棒，功能很全，你想要的都有了。邮件提醒这些。但是！很占空间。。。\n- 可以设置关键字去获取自己想要的。\n- 可以设置获取频率。（一小时一次还是一分钟一次。）\n\n### miniflux(我现在在使用的。)\n- 这个我就有很多发言权了。\n- 这个也是要自己搭建网站使用的。\n- 网站非常精简，只有最基本功能。其实认真想想，最基本功能就够了，也没必要用这么多。重要提醒完全可以使用IFTTT。\n- 有快捷键。\n- 可以多用户。\n- 可以设置获取频率。（一小时一次还是一分钟一次。）\n\n## 信息阅读——阅读器\n- 这个其实可以不用的。一般网站会给你直接阅读，但是为了阅读体验。最好使用自己的阅读器。而且一般网站都没有安卓ios客户端。（有也不好用哇）\n\n### ios Mac feeder(30块钱)\n- 这个是我一开始使用RSS的时候就一直在用的阅读器。\n- 到我这版是feeder4，网站分类做的是真的好。\n- 有bioreader功能。（阅读英文有用）\n\n### unread ios 68块/ android\n- 这个软件在全面屏体验非常好的。完全沉浸式阅读体验极佳。\n- 不支持软件内播放视频。（就这点让我不太想要了{你只是缺钱/xyx}）\n\n# 总结\n- 想好订阅什么网站就去订阅 + 阅读吧。加油！\n\n\n\n","tags":["RSS","ttrss","feed43","rsshub","miniflux","inoreader","feeder","unread"]},{"title":"考研英语二真题2010-2019","url":"/2019/10/10/考研英语二真题2010-2019/","content":"# 2010\nSection I Use

(40 points)\n\nText 1\n\nThe longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, \"Beautiful Inside My Head Forever\", at Sotheby's in London on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than ￡70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nThe world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare Mc Andrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm — double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries.\n\n\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector — for Chinese contemporary art — they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them.\n\n\n\nThe current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says: \"I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom.\"\n\n\n\nWhat makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie's revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds — death, debt and divorce — still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.\n\n\n 21. In the first paragraph, Damien Hirst's sale was referred to as \"a last victory\" because ________. \n  [A] the art market had witnessed a succession of victories  \n  [B] the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids  \n  [C] Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces  \n  [D] it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22.By saying \"spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable\" (Line 1-2, Para.3), the author suggests that ________. \n  [A] collectors were no longer actively involved in art-market auctions  \n  [B] people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries  \n  [C] art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent  \n  [D] works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. Which of the following statements is NOT true? \n  [A] Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from 2007 to 2008.  \n  [B] The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum.  \n  [C] The market generally went downward in various ways.  \n  [D] Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are ________. \n  [A] auction houses' favorites　  \n  [B] contemporary trends  \n  [C] factors promoting artwork circulation　  \n  [D] styles representing impressionists  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. The most appropriate title for this text could be ________. \n  [A] Fluctuation of Art Prices  \n  [B] Up-to-date Art Auctions  \n  [C] Art Market in Decline  \n  [D] Shifted Interest in Arts  \n  \n\n\nText 2\n\nI was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room — a women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, \"She's the talker in our family.\" The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. \"It's true,\" he explained. \"When I come home from work, I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence.\"\n\n\n\nThis episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage.\n\n\n\nThe pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book \"Divorce Talk\" that most of the women she interviewed — but only a few of the men — gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year — a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.\n\n\n\nIn my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking, social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused on communication: \"He doesn't listen to me.\" \"He doesn't talk to me.\" I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives.\n\n\n\nIn short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk.\n\n\n 26. What is most wives' main expectation of their husbands? \n  [A] Talking to them.  \n  [B] Trusting them.　  \n  [C] Supporting their careers.　  \n  [D] Sharing housework.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. Judging from the context, the phrase \"wreaking havoc\" (Line 3,Para.2) most probably means ________. \n  [A] generating motivation.  \n  [B] exerting influence　  \n  [C] causing damage　  \n  [D] creating pressure  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. All of the following are true EXCEPT ________. \n  [A] men tend to talk more in public than women  \n  [B] nearly 50 percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation  \n  [C] women attach much importance to communication between couples  \n  [D] a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. Which of the following can best summarize the main idea of this text? \n  [A] The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists.  \n  [B] Marriage break-up stems from sex inequalities.  \n  [C] Husband and wife have different expectations from their marriage.  \n  [D] Conversational patterns between man and wife are different.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. In the following part immediately after this text, the author will most probably focus on ________. \n  [A] a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk  \n  [B] a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon  \n  [C] other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U.S.  \n  [D] a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker  \n  \n\n\nText 3\n\nOver the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors — habits — among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.\n\n\n\n\"There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers only because we can't figure out how to change people's habits,\" Dr. Curtis said. \"We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.\"\n\n\n\nThe companies that Dr. Curtis turned to — Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever — had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers' lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.\n\n\n\nIf you look hard enough, you'll find that many of the products we use every day — chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins — are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.\n\n\n\nA few decades ago, many people didn't drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.\n\n\n\n\"Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,\" said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. \"Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers' lives, and it's essential to making new products commercially viable.\"\n\n\n\nThrough experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods.\n\n\n 31. According to Dr. Curtis, habits like hand washing with soap ________. \n  [A] should be further cultivated  \n  [B] should be changed gradually  \n  [C] are deeply rooted in history  \n  [D] are basically private concerns  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. Bottled water, chewing gun and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph 5 so as to ________. \n  [A] reveal their impact on people's habits  \n  [B] show the urgent need of daily necessities  \n  [C] indicate their effect on people's buying power  \n  [D] manifest the significant role of good habits  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. Which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people's habits? \n  [A] Tide  \n  [B] Crest  \n  [C] Colgate  \n  [D] Unilever  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. From the text we know that some of consumer's habits are developed due to ________. \n  [A] perfected art of products  \n  [B] automatic behavior creation  \n  [C] commercial promotions  \n  [D] scientific experiments  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. The author's attitude toward the influence of advertisement on people's habits is ________. \n  [A] indifferent  \n  [B] negative  \n  [C] positive  \n  [D] biased  \n  \n\n\nText 4\n\nMany Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.\n\n\n\nBut as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.\n\n\n\nThe system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.\n\n\n\nIn 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.\n\n\n 36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that ________. \n  [A] both liberate and illiterate people can serve on juries  \n  [B] defendants are immune from trial by their peers  \n  [C] no age limit should be imposed for jury service  \n  [D] judgment should consider the opinion of the public  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37.

(10 points)\n\nCopying Birds May Save Aircraft Fuel\n\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft, the 787 and A350 respectively. Their clever designs and lightweight composites certainly make a difference. But a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by Ilan Kroo, has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to cutting jet-fuel use, and it would not require them to buy new aircraft.\n\nThe answer, says Dr Kroo, lies with birds. Since 1914, and a seminal paper by a German researcher called Carl Wiesel Berger, scientists have known that birds flying in formation—a V-shape, echelon or otherwise—expend less energy. The air flowing over a bird's wings curls upwards behind the wingtips, a phenomenon known as upwash. Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag, and spend less energy propelling themselves. Peter Lissaman, an aeronautics expert who was formerly at Caltech and the University of Southern California, has suggested that a formation of 25 birds might enjoy a range increase of 71%.\n\nWhen applied to aircraft, the principles are not substantially different. Dr Kroo and his team modeled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas were to rendezvous over Utah, assume an inverted V-formation, occasionally swap places so all could have a turn in the most favorable positions, and proceed to London. They found that the aircraft consumed as much as 15% less fuel (coupled with a reduction in carbon-dioxide output). Nitrogen-oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by around a quarter.\n\nThere are, of course, kinks to be worked out. One consideration is safety, or at least the perception of it. Would passengers feel comfortable traveling in convoy? Dr Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles, and would not be in the intimate groupings favored by display teams like the Red Arrows. A passenger peering out of the window might not even see the other planes. Whether the separation distances involved would satisfy air-traffic-control regulations is another matter, although a working group at the International Civil Aviation Organization has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new operational guidelines.\n\nIt remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make formation flight more efficient. In zones of increased turbulence, the planes' wakes will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish. Dr Kroo says this is one of the areas his team will investigate further. It might also be hard for airlines to co-ordinate the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow them to gain from formation flight. Cargo aircraft, in contrast, might be easier to reschedule, as might routine military flights.\n\nAs it happens, America's armed forces are on the case already. Earlier this year the country's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay Boeing to investigate formation flight, though the program has yet to begin. There are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel during the Second World War, but Dr Lissaman says they are apocryphal. \"My father was an RAF pilot and my cousin the skipper of a Lancaster lost over Berlin,\" he adds. So he should know.\n\n41. Findings of the Stanford University researchers will promote the sales of new Boeing and Airbus aircraft.\n\n42. The upwash experience may save propelling energy as well as reducing resistance.\n\n43. Formation flight is more comfortable because passengers can not see the other planes.\n\n44. The role that weather plays in formation flight has not yet been clearly defined.\n\n45. It has been documented that during World War II, America's armed forces once tried formation flight to save fuel.\n   \n    \n   \n\n   \nPart C\n\nDirections:\nIn this section there is a text in English.

But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cyber-crime that has 1 across the We[b]\n\nCan privacy be preserved 2 bringing safety and security to a world that seems increasingly 3?\n\nLast month, Howard Schmidt, the nation's cyber-czar, offered the federal government a 4 to make the Web a safer place-a \"voluntary trusted identity\" system that would be the high-tech 5 of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled 6 one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential 7 to a specific computer .and would authenticate users at a range of online services.\n\nThe idea is to 8 a federation of private online identity systems.

The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver's license 10 by the government.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft are among companies that already have these \"single sign-on\" systems that make it possible for users to 11 just once but use many different services.\n\n12, the approach would create a \"walled garden\" n cyberspace, with safe \"neighborhoods\" and bright \"streetlights\" to establish a sense of a 13 community.\n\nMr. Schmidt described it as a \"voluntary ecosystem\" in which \"individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with 14,trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure 15 which the transaction runs\".\n\nStill, the administration's plan has 16 privacy rights activists.

For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much criticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman's compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.\n\n\n\nOutside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm's board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive's proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises.\n\n\n\nThe researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those \"surprise\" disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they \"trade up.\" Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.\n\n\n\nBut the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.\n\n\n   \n 21. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for ________. \n  [A] gaining excessive profits  \n  [B] failing to fulfill her duty  \n  [C] refusing to make compromises  \n  [D] leaving the board in tough times  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. We learn from Paragraph 2 that outside directors are supposed to be ________. \n  [A] generous investors  \n  [B] unbiased executives  \n  [C] share price forecasters  \n  [D] independent advisers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. According to the researchers from Ohio University after an outside director's surprise departure, the firm is likely to ________. \n  [A] become more stable  \n  [B] report increased earnings  \n  [C] do less well in the stock market  \n  [D] perform worse in lawsuits  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors ________. \n  [A] may stay for the attractive offers from the firm  \n  [B] have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm  \n  [C] are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm  \n  [D] will decline incentives from the firm  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. The author's attitude toward the role of outside directors is ________. \n  [A] permissive  \n  [B] positive  \n  [C] scornful  \n  [D] critical  \n  \n\n\n    \nText 2\n\nWhatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America's Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them? It will hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date.\n\n\n\nIn much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.\n\n\n\nIt has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further.\n\n\n\nNewspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable.\n\n\n\nThe whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.\n\n\n 26. By saying \"Newspapers like … their own doom\" (Lines 3-4, Para. 1), the author indicates that newspaper ________. \n  [A] neglected the sign of crisis  \n  [B] failed to get state subsidies  \n  [C] were not charitable corporations  \n  [D] were in a desperate situation  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because ________. \n  [A] readers threatened to pay less  \n  [B] newspapers wanted to reduce costs  \n  [C] journalists reported little about these areas  \n  [D] subscribers complained about slimmer products  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. Compared with their American counterparts, Japanese newspapers are much more stable because they ________. \n  [A] have more sources of revenue  \n  [B] have more balanced newsrooms  \n  [C] are less dependent on advertising  \n  [D] are less affected by readership  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business? \n  [A] Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.  \n  [B] Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper.  \n  [C] Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business.  \n  [D] Readers have lost their interest in car and film reviews.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. The most appropriate title for this text would be ________. \n  [A] American Newspapers: Struggling for Survival  \n  [B] American Newspapers: Gone with the Wind  \n  [C] American Newspapers: A Thriving Business  \n  [D] American Newspapers: A Hopeless Story  \n  \n\n\n\nText 3\n\nWe tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G.I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus.\n\n\n\nBut when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.\n\n\n\nEconomic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase \"less is more\" was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies.\n\n\n\nMies's signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies's sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty.\n\n\n\nThe apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller — two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet — than those in their older neighbors along the city's Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings' details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time.\n\n\n\nThe trend toward \"less\" was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses — usually around 1,200 square feet — than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.\n\n\n\nThe \"Case Study Houses\" commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the \"less is more\" trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everyday life — few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers — but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared.\n\n\n 31. The postwar American housing style largely reflected the Americans' ________. \n  [A] prosperity and growth  \n  [B] efficiency and practicality  \n  [C] restraint and confidence  \n  [D] pride and faithfulness  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3 about Bauhaus? \n  [A] It was founded by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.  \n  [B] Its designing concept was affected by World War II.  \n  [C] Most American architects used to be associated with it.  \n  [D] It had a great influence upon American architecture.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. Mies held that elegance of architectural design ________. \n  [A] was related to large space  \n  [B] was identified with emptiness  \n  [C] was not reliant on abundant decoration  \n  [D] was not associated with efficiency  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. What is true about the apartments Mies building Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? \n  [A] They ignored details and proportions.  \n  [B] They were built with materials popular at that time.  \n  [C] They were more spacious than neighboring buildings.  \n  [D] They shared some characteristics of abstract art.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. What can we learn about the design of the \"Case Study House\"? \n  [A] Mechanical devices were widely used.  \n  [B] Natural scenes were taken into consideration  \n  [C] Details were sacrificed for the overall effect.  \n  [D] Eco-friendly materials were employed.  \n  \n\n\n   \nText 4\n\nWill the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the project's greatest cheerleader's talk of a continent facing a \"Bermuda triangle\" of debt, population decline and lower growth.\n\n\n\nAs well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone's economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.\n\n\n\nYet the debate about how to save Europe's single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone's dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.\n\n\n\nGermany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrow spending and competitiveness, barked by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country's voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigors; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference.\n\n\n\nA \"southern\" camp headed by French wants something different: \"European economic government\" within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs.\n\n\n\nIt is too soon to write off the EU.It remains the world's largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism benign.\n\n\n   \n 36. The EU is faced with so many problems that ________. \n  [A] it has more or less lost faith in markets  \n  [B] even its supporters begin to feel concerned  \n  [C] some of its member countries plan to abandon euro  \n  [D] it intends to deny the possibility of devaluation  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37.

(10 points)\n\nLeading doctors today weigh in on the debate over the government's role in promoting public health by demanding that ministers impose \"fat taxes\" on unhealthy food and introduce cigarette-style warnings to children about the dangers of a poor diet.\n\nThe demands follow comments last week by the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, who insisted the government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health regulations.\n\nBut senior medical figures want to stop fast-food outlets opening near schools, restrict advertising of products high in fat, salt or sugar, and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast-food producers such as McDonald's.\n\nThey argue that government action is necessary to curb Britain's addiction to unhealthy food and help halt spiraling rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as damaging as smoking or binge drinking.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the workplace or in pubs, and yet that is what we have now. Are we willing to be just as courageous in respect of obesity?

School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student's academic grade.\n\n\n\nThis rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be assigned that students cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.\n\n\n\nDistrict administrators say that homework will still be a pat of schooling: teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see vey little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students' academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework does nothing to ensure that the homework students are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.\n\n\n\nThe homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework right.\n\n\n 21. It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework ________. \n  [A] is receiving more criticism  \n  [B] is no longer an educational ritual  \n  [C] is not required for advanced courses  \n  [D] is gaining more preferences  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. L.A. Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students ________. \n  [A] tend to have moderate expectations for their education  \n  [B] have asked for a different educational standard  \n  [C] may have problems finishing their homework  \n  [D] have voiced their complaints about homework  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. According to Paragraph 3, one problem with the policy is that it may ________. \n  [A] discourage students from doing homework  \n  [B] result in students' indifference to their report cards  \n  [C] undermine the authority of state tests  \n  [D] restrict teachers' power in education  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. As mentioned in Paragraph 4, a key question unanswered about homework is whether ________. \n  [A] it should be eliminated  \n  [B] it counts much in schooling  \n  [C] it places extra burdens on teachers  \n  [D] it is important for grades  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. A suitable title for this text could be ________. \n  [A] Wrong Interpretation of an Educational Policy  \n  [B] A Welcomed Policy for Poor Students  \n  [C] Thorny Questions about Homework  \n  [D] A Faulty Approach to Homework  \n  \n\nText 2\n\nPretty in pink: adult women do not remember being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young girls' lives. It is not that pink intrinsically bad, but it is a tiny slice of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fused girls' identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls' lives and interests.\n\n\n\nGirls' attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it's not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What's more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses. When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children's marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, when it began to seem innately attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.\n\n\n\nI had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kids, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children's behaviour: wrong. Turns out, according to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularised as a marketing gimmick by clothing manufacturers in the 1930s.\n\n\n\nTrade publications counseled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should create a \"third stepping stone\" between infant wear and older kids' clothes. It was only after \"toddler\" became common shoppers' term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences – or invent them where they did not previously exist.\n\n\n   \n 26. By saying \"it is ... The rainbow\"(line 3, Para 1), the author means pink ________. \n  [A] should not be the sole representation of girlhood  \n  [B] should not be associated with girls' innocence  \n  [C] cannot explain girls' lack of imagination  \n  [D] cannot influence girls' lives and interests  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours? \n  [A] Colors are encoded in girls' DNA  \n  [B] Blue used to be regarded as the color for girls  \n  [C] Pink used to be a neutral color in symbolizing genders  \n  [D] White is preferred by babies  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological devotement was much influenced by ________. \n  [A] the marketing of products for children  \n  [B] the observation of children's nature  \n  [C] researches into children's behavior  \n  [D] studies of childhood consumption  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised ________. \n  [A] focuses on infant wear and older kids' clothes  \n  [B] attach equal importance to different genders  \n  [C] classify consumers into smaller groups  \n  [D] create some common shoppers' terms  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. It can be concluded that girl's attraction to pink seems to be ________. \n  [A] clearly explained by their inborn tendency  \n  [B] fully understood by clothing manufacturers  \n  [C] mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen  \n  [D] well interpreted by psychological experts  \n  \n\n\n\nText 3\n\nIn 2010, a federal judge shook America's biotech industry to its core. Companies had won patents for isolated DNA for decades — by 2005 some 20% of human genes were patented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable. Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a \"preliminary step\" in a longer battle.\n\n\n\nOn July 29th they were relieved, at least temporarily. A federal appeals court overturned the prior decision, ruling that Myriad Genetics could indeed hold patents to two genes that help forecast a woman's risk of breast cancer. The chief executive of Myriad, a company in Utah, said the ruling was a blessing to firms and patients alike.\n\n\n\nBut as companies continue their attempts at personalised medicine, the courts will remain rather busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments against gene patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an isolated DNA molecule \"is no less a product of nature... than are cotton fibres that have been separated from cotton seeds.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the appeals court's decision, big questions remain unanswered. For example, it is unclear whether the sequencing of a whole genome violates the patents of individual genes within it. The case may yet reach the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nAS the industry advances, however, other suits may have an even greater impact. Companies are unlikely to file many more patents for human DNA molecules — most are already patented or in the public domain. firms are now studying how genes interact, looking for correlations that might be used to determine the causes of disease or predict a drug's efficacy. Companies are eager to win patents for \"connecting the dots\", explains Hans Sauer, a lawyer for the BIO.\n\n\n\nTheir success may be determined by a suit related to this issue, brought by the Mayo Clinic, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term. The BIO recently held a convention which included sessions to coach lawyers on the shifting landscape for patents. Each meeting was packed.\n\n 31. It can be learned from paragraph I that the biotech companies would like ________. \n  [A] their executives to be active  \n  [B] judges to rule out gene patenting  \n  [C] genes to be patentable  \n  [D] the BIO to issue a warning  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. Those who are against gene patents believe that ________. \n  [A] genetic tests are not reliable  \n  [B] only man-made products are patentable  \n  [C] patents on genes depend much on innovations  \n  [D] courts should restrict access to genetic tests  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. According to Hans Sauer, companies are eager to win patents for ________. \n  [A] establishing disease correlations  \n  [B] discovering gene interactions  \n  [C] drawing pictures of genes  \n  [D] identifying human DNA  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. By saying \"each meeting was packed\" (line4, para6) the author means that ________. \n  [A] the Supreme Court was authoritative  \n  [B] the BIO was a powerful organization  \n  [C] gene patenting was a great concern  \n  [D] lawyers were keen to attend conventions  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. Generally speaking, the author's attitude toward gene patenting is ________. \n  [A] critical  \n  [B] supportive  \n  [C] scornful  \n  [D] objective  \n  \n\n\nText 4\n\nThe great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends, it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics, our culture, and the character of our society for years.\n\n\n\nNo one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.\n\n\n\nBut for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S., lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.\n\n\n\nIncome inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one. Indeed, this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them — especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.\n\n\n\nIn the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden within American society. More difficult, in the moment, is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society's character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this recession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly it, and all the more so the longer they extend.\n\n\n 36. By saying \"to find silver linings\"（Line 1,Para.2）the author suggest that the jobless try to ________. \n  [A] seek subsidies from the government  \n  [B] explore reasons for the unemployment  \n  [C] make profits from the troubled economy  \n  [D] look on the bright side of the recession  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. According to Paragraph 2,the recession has made people ________. \n  [A] realize the national dream  \n  [B] struggle against each other  \n  [C] challenge their lifestyle  \n  [D] reconsider their lifestyle  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. Benjamin Friedman believed that economic recession may ________. \n  [A] impose a heavier burden on immigrants  \n  [B] bring out more evils of human nature  \n  [C] Promote the advance of rights and freedoms  \n  [D] ease conflicts between races and classes  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39.

Well, not any more it is not.\n\nSuddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.\n\nFrom the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus - On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, the championed cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.\n\nOver time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers , industrialists and explores . \"The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, if patient purpose, resolute working and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formulation of truly noble and many character, exhibit,\"wrote Smiles.\" what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself.\" His biographies of James Walt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.\n\nThis was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals.\n\nCommunist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles: \"It is man, real, living man who does all that.\" And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle. As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For:\"Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.\"\n\nThis was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding - from gender to race to cultural studies - were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.\n\n[A] emphasized the virtue of classical heroes.\n\n[B] highlighted the public glory of the leading artists.\n\n[C] focused on epochal figures whose lives were hard to imitate.\n\n[D] opened up new realms of understanding the great men in history.\n\n[E] held that history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle.\n\n[F] dismissed virtue as unnecessary for successful leaders.\n\n[G] depicted the worthy lives of engineer industrialists and explorers.\n\n41.

Third, the use of paper checks gives consumers several days of \"float\" - it takes several days 11 a check is cashed and funds are 12 from the issuer's account, which means that the writer of the check can cam interest on the funds in the meantime. 13 electronic payments arc immediate, they eliminate the float for the consumer.\n\nFourth, electronic means of payment may 14 security and privacy concerns. We often hear media reports that an unauthorized hacker has been able to access a computer database and to alter information 15 there. The fact that this is not an 16 occurrence means that dishonest persons might be able to access bank accounts in electronic payments systems and 17 from someone else's accounts. The 18 of this type of fraud is no easy task, and a new field of computer science is developing to 19 security issues. A further concern is that the use of electronic means of payment leaves an electronic 20 that contains a large amount of personal data. There are concerns that government, employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby violating our privacy.\n\n1.

Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET 1. （40 points）\n\nText 1\n\nIn an essay entitled \"Making It in America\", the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,\" a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.\"\n\n\n\nDavidson's article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign worker.\n\n\n\nIn the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to. It can't when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra-their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.\n\n\n\nYes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there's been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, \"In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs — about 6 million in total — disappeared.\n\n\n\nThere will always be changed — new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.\n\n\n\nIn a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I. Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to post-high school education.\n\n\n   \n 21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate ________. \n  [A] the impact of technological advances  \n  [B] the alleviation of job pressure  \n  [C] the shrinkage of textile mills  \n  [D] the decline of middle-class incomes  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to ________. \n  [A] work on cheap software  \n  [B] ask for a moderate salary  \n  [C] adopt an average lifestyle  \n  [D] contribute something unique  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that ________. \n  [A] gains of technology have been erased  \n  [B] job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed  \n  [C] factories are making much less money than before  \n  [D] new jobs and services have been offered  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. According to the author, to reduce unemployment, the most important is ________. \n  [A] to accelerate the I.T. revolution  \n  [B] to ensure more education for people  \n  [C] to advance economic globalization  \n  [D] to pass more bills in the 21st century  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text? \n  [A] New Law Takes Effect  \n  [B] Technology Goes Cheap  \n  [C] Average Is Over  \n  [D] Recession Is Bad  \n  \n\n\nText 2\n\nA century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and sojourners. Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7 millin people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian immigrants, for example, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, \"uccelli di passaggio,\" birds of passage.\n\n\n\nToday, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into two categories: legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or our broken immigration system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don't need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal. \n\n\n\nTo start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.\n\n\n\nCrop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today's birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work, money and ideas. They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them, They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another.\n\n\n\nWith or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably.\n\n\n\nAccommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle. Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes. Including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.\n\n\n   \n 26. \"Birds of passage\" refers to those who ________. \n  [A] immigrate across the Atlantic  \n  [B] leave their home countries for good  \n  [C] stay in a foreign temporarily  \n  [D] find permanent jobs overseas  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. It is implied in paragraph 2 that the current immigration system in the US ________. \n  [A] needs new immigrant categories  \n  [B] has loosened control over immigrants  \n  [C] should be adopted to meet challenges  \n  [D] has been fixed via political means  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. According to the author, today's birds of passage want ________. \n  [A] financial incentives.  \n  [B] a global recognition.  \n  [C] opportunities to get regular jobs.  \n  [D] the freedom to stay and leave.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. The author suggests that the birds of passage today should be treated ________. \n  [A] as faithful partners.  \n  [B] with economic favors.  \n  [C] with regal tolerance.  \n  [D] as mighty rivals.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. which is the best title of the passage? \n  [A] come and go: big mistake  \n  [B] living and thriving : great risk  \n  [C] with or without : great risk  \n  [D] legal or illegal: big mistake  \n  \n\n\n\nText 3\n\nScientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.\n\n\n\nSnap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like neuroticism or open-mindedness.\n\n\n\nBut snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren't exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we're doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long.\n\n\n\nYet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases-or hire outside screeners.\n\n\n\nJohn Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly \"thin slice\" information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in \"thick sliced\" long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a muck longer evaluation; two days, not two seconds.\n\n\n\nOur ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: doge can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the way we react, it hasn't changed our nature. We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.\n\n\n   \n 31. The time needed in making decisions may ________. \n  [A] vary according to the urgency of the situation  \n  [B] prove the complexity of our brain reaction  \n  [C] depend on the importance of the assessment  \n  [D] predetermine the accuracy of our judgment  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. Our reaction to a fast-food logo shows that snap decisions ________. \n  [A] can be associative  \n  [B] are not unconscious  \n  [C] can be dangerous  \n  [D] are not impulsive  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. To reverse the negative influences of snap decisions, we should ________. \n  [A] trust our first impression  \n  [B] do as people usually do  \n  [C] think before we act  \n  [D] ask for expert advice  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. John Gottman says that reliable snap reaction are based on ________. \n  [A] critical assessment  \n  [B]'thin sliced'study  \n  [C] sensible explanation  \n  [D] adequate information  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. The author's attitude toward reversing the high-speed trend is ________. \n  [A] tolerant  \n  [B] uncertain  \n  [C] optimistic  \n  [D] doubtful  \n  \n\n\n\nText 4\n\nEurope is not a gender-equality heaven. In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family—friendly until women are part of senior management decisions, and Europe's top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male. Indeed, women hold only 14 percent of positions on Europe corporate boards.\n\n\n\nThe Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women-up to 60 percent. This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.\n\n\n\nDo we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance work and family?\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I don't like quotas,\" Reding said recently. \"But I like what the quotas do.\" Quotas get action: they \"open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,\" according to Reding, a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.\n\n\n\nI understand Reding's reluctance — and her frustration. I don't like quotas either; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy, government by the capable. But, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.\n\n\n\nAfter all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position — no matter how much \"soft pressure \" is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of corporate power — as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook — they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.\n\n\n\nIf appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women — whether CEOs or their children's caregivers — and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society.\n\n\n   \n 36. In the European corporate workplace, generally ________. \n  [A] women take the lead  \n  [B] men have the final say  \n  [C] corporate governance is overwhelmed  \n  [D] senior management is family-friendly  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. The European Union's intended legislation is ________. \n  [A] a reflection of gender balance  \n  [B] a reluctant choice  \n  [C] a response to Reding's call  \n  [D] a voluntary action  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. According to Reding, quotas may help women ________. \n  [A] get top business positions  \n  [B] see through the glass ceiling  \n  [C] balance work and family  \n  [D] anticipate legal results  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39. The author's attitude toward Reding's appeal is one of ________. \n  [A] skepticism  \n  [B] objectiveness  \n  [C] indifference  \n  [D] approval  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 40. Women entering top management become headlines due to the lack of ________. \n  [A] more social justice  \n  [B] massive media attention  \n  [C] suitable public policies  \n  [D] greater \"soft pressure\"  \n  \n\n\n\nPart B\n\nDirections:\nYou are going to read a list of headings and a text.

It's also a good idea to shop daily instead of weekly, because, being-human, you'll sometimes change your mind about what you fancy.\n\n42. _____________________\n\nThis is where supermarkets and their anonymity come in handy. With them, there's not the same embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little greengrocer.

Planning ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables you'll do a vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to \"go off' will be cooked or juiced.\n\n44. _____________________\n\nEveryone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers, delis and fish-sellers regularly, even for small things, and be super friendly.

And there are health conditions for which being overweight is actually 2. For example, heavier women are less likely to develop calcium deficiency than thin women. 3 among the elderly, being somewhat overweight is often an 4 of good health.\n\nOf even greater 5 is the fact that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define. It is often defined 6 body mass index, or BMI. BMI 7 body mass divided by the square of height. An adult with a BMI of 18 to 25 is often considered to be normal weight. Between 25 and 30 is overweight. And over 30 is considered obese. Obesity, 8,can be divided into moderately obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.\n\nWhile such numerical standards seem 9, they are not. Obesity is probably less a matter of weight than body fat. Some people with a high BMI are in fact extremely fit, 10 others with a low BMI may be in poor 11. For example, many collegiate and professional football players 12 as obese, though their percentage body fat is low. Conversely, someone with a small frame may have high body fat but a 13 BMI.\n\nToday we have a(an) 14 to label obesity as a disgrace.The overweight are sometimes 15 in the media with their faces covered. Stereotypes 16 with obesity include laziness, lack of will power,and lower prospects for success.Teachers,employers,and health professionals have been shown to harbor biases against the obese. 17 very young children tend to look down on the overweight, and teasing about body build has long been a problem in schools.\n\nNegative attitudes toward obesity, 18 in health concerns, have stimulated a number of anti-obesity 19. My own hospital system has banned sugary drinks from its facilities. Many employers have instituted weight loss and fitness initiatives. Michelle Obama launched a high-visibility campaign 20 childhood obesity, even claiming that it represents our greatest national security threat.\n\n\n1.

This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from her small, tinroofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton.\n\n\n\nThese two academics use an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways to spend money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visions of fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with these material purchases wears off fairly quickly. What was once exciting and new becomes oldhat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money on experiences, say Ms. Dumn and Mr. Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. These purchases often become more valuable with time — as stories or memories — particularly if they involve feeling more connected to others.\n\n\n\nThis slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most \"happiness bang for your buck.\" It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it). Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason MacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib — a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.\n\n\n\nReaders of Happy Money are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger. Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not everyone will agree with the authors' policy ideas, which range from mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers.

We have a deepseated need to feel good about ourselves and we naturally employ a number of selfenhancing strategies to research into what they call the \"above average effect\", or \"illusory superiority\", and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% at getting on well with others — all obviously statistical impossibilities.\n\n\n\nWe rose tint our memories and put ourselves into selfaffirming situations. We become defensive when criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our own esteem, we stalk around thinking we're hot stuff.\n\n\n\nPsychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying into selfenhancement and attractiveness. Rather that have people simply rate their beauty compress with others, he asked them to identify an original photograph of themselves' from a lineup including versions that had been altered to appear more and less attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is \"an automatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparent conscious deliberation\". If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flattering image — which must did — they genuinely believed it was really how they looked.\n\n\n\nEpley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor was there any evidence that, those who selfenhance the must (that is, the participants who thought the most positively doctored picture were real) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In fact those who thought that the images higher up the attractiveness scale were real directly corresponded with those who showed other makers for having higher selfesteem. \"I don't think the findings that we having have are any evidence of personal delusion\", says Epley. \"It's a reflection simply of people generally thinking well of themselves\". If you are depressed, you won't be selfenhancing.\n\n\n\nKnowing the results of Epley's study, it makes sense that why people heat photographs of themselves viscerally — on one level, they don't even recognize the person in the picture as themselves. Facebook therefore, is a selfenhancer's paradise, where people can share only the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit, style, beauty, intellect and lifestyles. \"It's not that people's profiles are dishonest\", says Catalina Toma of Wiscon—Madison university,\" but they portray an idealized version of themselves.\n\n\n   \n 26. According to the first paragraph, social psychologists have found that ________. \n  [A] our selfratings are unrealistically high  \n  [B] illusory superiority is a baseless effect  \n  [C] our need for leadership is unnatural  \n  [D] selfenhancing strategies are ineffective  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. Visual recognition is believed to be people's ________. \n  [A] rapid watching  \n  [B] conscious choice  \n  [C] intuitive response  \n  [D] automatic selfdefence  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. Epley found that people with higher selfesteem tended to ________. \n  [A] underestimate their insecurities  \n  [B] believe in their attractiveness  \n  [C] cover up their depressions  \n  [D] oversimplify their illusions  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. The word \"viscerally\" (Line 2, Para. 5) is closest in meaning to ________. \n  [A] instinctively  \n  [B] occasionally  \n  [C] particularly  \n  [D] aggressively  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. It can be inferred that Facebook is selfenhancer's paradise because people can ________. \n  [A] present their dishonest profiles  \n  [B] define their traditional life styles  \n  [C] share their intellectual pursuits  \n  [D] withhold their unflattering sides  \n  \n\n\n\n\nText 3\n\nThe concept of man versus machine is at least as old as the industrial revolution, but this phenomenon tends to be most acutely felt during economic downturns and fragile recoveries. And yet, it would be a mistake to think we are right now simply experiencing the painful side of a boom and bust cycle. Certain jobs have gone away for good, outmoded by machines. Since technology has such an insatiable appetite for eating up human jobs, this phenomenon will continue to restructure our economy in ways we can't immediately foresee.\n\n\n\nWhen there is rapid improvement in the price and performance of technology, jobs that were once thought to be immune from automation suddenly become threatened. This argument has attracted a lot of attention, via the success of the book Race Against the Machine, by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who both hail from MIT's Center for Digital Business.\n\n\n\nThis is a powerful argument, and a scary one. And yet, John Hagel, author of The Power of Pull and other books, says Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss the reason why these jobs are so vulnerable to technology in the first place.\n\n\n\nHagel says we have designed jobs in the U. S. that tend to be \"tightly scripted\" and \"highly standardized\" ones that leave no room for \"individual initiative or creativity.\" In short, these are the types of jobs that machines can perform much better at than human beings. That is how we have put a giant target sign on the backs of American workers, Hagel says.\n\n\n\nIt's time to reinvent the formula for how work is conducted, since we are still relying on a very 20th century notion of work, Hagel says. In our rapidly changing economy, we more than ever need people in the workplace who can take initiative and exercise their imagination \"to respond to unexpected events.\" That's not something machines are good at. They are designed to perform very predictable activities.\n\n\n\nAs Hagel notes, Brynjolfsson and McAfee indeed touched on this point in their book. We need to reframe race against the machine as race with the machine. In other words, we need to look at the ways in which machines can augment human labor rather than replace it. So then the problem is not really about technology, but rather, \"how do we innovate our institutions and our work practices?\"\n\n\n 31. According to the first paragraph, economic downturns would ________. \n  [A] ease the competition of man vs. Machine  \n  [B] highlight machines' threat to human jobs  \n  [C] provoke a painful technological revolution  \n  [D] outmode our current economic structure  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. The authors of Race Against the Machine argue that ________. \n  [A] technology is diminishing man's job opportunities  \n  [B] automation is accelerating technological development  \n  [C] certain jobs will remain intact after automation  \n  [D] man will finally win the race against machine  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. Hagel argues that jobs in the U.S. are often ________. \n  [A] performed by innovative minds  \n  [B] scripted with an individual style  \n  [C] standardized without a clear target  \n  [D] designed against human creativity  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. According to the last paragraph, Brynjolfsson and McAfee discussed ________. \n  [A] the predictability of machine behavior in practice  \n  [B] the formula for how work is conducted efficiently  \n  [C] the ways machines replace human labor in modern times  \n  [D] the necessity of human involvement in the workplace  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35.

Housing is seldom mentioned.\n\n\n\nWhy is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder the blame. We have not been good at communicating the real value that housing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scale of the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attention among multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it is inevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps the most significant reason is that the issue has always been so politically charged.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate. Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not building enough new homes.\n\n\n\nThe comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for the government to help rectify this. It needs to put historical prejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgent housing need.\n\n\n\nThere are some indications that it is preparing to do just that. The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce more flexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authorities can borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that 60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years if the cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.\n\n\n\nMinisters should also look at creating greater certainty in the rental environment, which would have a significant impact on the ability of registered providers to fund new developments from revenues.\n\n\n\nBut it is not just down to the government. While these measures would be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the fact that the existing ￡4.5bn programme of grants to fund new affordable housing, set to expire in 2015, is unlikely to be extended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced that it will retain a large part of the coalition's spending plans if returns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we are very unlikely to ever return to era of largescale public grants. We need to adjust to this changing climate.\n\n\n\nWhile the government's commitment to long-term funding may have changed, the very pressing need for more affordable housing is real and is not going away.\n\n\n 36. The author believes that the housing sector ________. \n  [A] has attracted much attention  \n  [B] involves certain political factors  \n  [C] shoulders too much responsibility  \n  [D] has lost its real value in economy  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. It can be learned that affordable housing has ________. \n  [A] increased its home supply  \n  [B] offered spending opportunities  \n  [C] suffered government biases  \n  [D] disappointed the government  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. According to Paragraph 5, George Osborne may ________. \n  [A] allow greater government debt for housing  \n  [B] stop local authorities from building homes  \n  [C] prepare to reduce housing stock debt  \n  [D] release a lifted GDP growth forecast  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39.

(10 points)\n\nUncommon Ground - Land Art in Britain\n\nThe term Land Art brings to mind epic interventions in the land such as Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty, 6,500 tons of basalt, earth and salt projecting into Utah's Great Salt Lake, or Roden Crater, an extinct volcano in Arizona, which James Turrell has been transforming into an immense naked-eye observatory since 1979.\n\nRichard Long's A Line Made By Walking, however, involved nothing more strenuous than a 20-minute train ride from Waterloo. Having got off somewhere in suburbia, the artist walked backwards and forwards over a piece of grass until the squashed turf formed a line —— a kind of drawing on the land.\n\nEmerging in the late Sixties and reaching a peak in the Seventies, Land Art was one of a range of new forms, including Body Art, Performance Art, Action Art and Installation Art, which pushed art beyond the traditional confines of the studio and gallery. Rather than portraying landscape, land artists used the physical substance of the land itself as their medium.\n\nThe British Land Art, typified by Long's piece, was not only more domestically scaled, but a lot quirkier than its American counterpart.\n\nIndeed, while you might assume that an exhibition of Land Art would consist only of records of works rather than the works themselves, Long's photograph of his work is the work. Since his \"action\" is in the past, the photograph is its sole embodiment.\n\nThat might seem rather an obscure point, but it sets the tone for an exhibition that contains a lot of blackandwhite photographs and relatively few natural objects.\n\nLong is Britain's bestknown Land Artist and his Stone Circle, a perfect ring of purplish rocks from Portishead beach laid out on the gallery floor, represents the elegant, rarefied side of the form. The Boyle Family, on the other hand, stands for its dirty, urban aspect. Comprising artists Mark Boyle and Joan Hills and their children, they recreated random sections of the British landscape on gallery walls. Their Olaf Street Study, a square of brickstrewn waste ground, is one of the few works here to embrace the commonplaceness that characterises most of our experience of the landscape most of the time.\n\nParks feature, particularly in the earlier works, such as John Hilliard's very funny Across the Park, in which a longhaired stroller is variously smiled at by a pretty girl and unwittingly assaulted in a sequence of images that turn out to be different parts of the same photograph.\n\nGenerally however British land artists preferred to get away from towns, gravitating towards landscapes that are traditionally considered beautiful such as the Lake District or the Wiltshire Downs. While it probably wasn't apparent at the time, much of this work is permeated by a spirit of romantic escapism that the likes of Wordsworth would have readily understood. Derek Jarman's yellowtinted film Towards Avebury, a collection of long, mostly still shots of the Wiltshire landscape, evokes a tradition of English landscape painting stretching from Samuel Palmer to Paul Nash.\n\nIn the case of Hamish Fulton, you can't help feeling that the Scottish artist has simply found a way of making his love of walking pay. A typical work, such as Seven Days, consists of a single beautiful blackandwhite photograph taken on an epic walk, with the mileage and number of days taken listed beneath. British Land Art as shown in this well selected, but relatively modestly scaled exhibition wasn't about imposing on the landscape, more a kind of landscapeorientated light conceptual art created passing through. It had its origins in the great outdoors, but the results were as gallerybound as the paintings of Turner and Constable.\n\n[A] originates from a long walk that the artist took.\n\n[B] illustrates a kind of landscape-orientated light conceptual art.\n\n[C] reminds people of the English landscape painting tradition.\n\n[D] represents the elegance of the British land art.\n\n[E] depicts the ordinary side of the British land art.\n\n[F] embodies a romantic escape into the Scottish outdoors.\n\n[G] contains images from different parts of the same photograph.\n\n41.

(15 points)\n\nMost people would define optimism as endlessly happy, with a glass that's perpetually half full. But that's exactly the kind of false cheerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn't recommend. \"Healthy optimism means being in touch with reality,\" says Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor. According to Ben-Shahar, realistic optimists are those who make the best of things that happen, but not those who believe everything happens for the best.\n\nBen-Shahar uses three optimistic exercisers. When he feels down — say, after giving a bad lecture — he grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself that not every lecture can be a Nobel winner; some will be less effective than others. Next is reconstruction.\n\nHe analyzes the weak lecture, leaning lessons for the future about what works and what doesn't. Finally, there is perspective, which involves acknowledging that in the grand scheme of life, one lecture really doesn't matter.\n   \n   \nPart A\n\n51.

Everyone around us seems to agree by the way they fiddle with their phones, even without a 1 underground.\n\nIt's a sad reality — our desire to avoid interacting with other human beings — because there's 2 to be gained from talking to the stranger standing by you. But you wouldn't know it, 3 into your phone. This universal armor sends the 4: \"Please don't approach me.\"\n\nWhat is it that makes us feel we need to hide 5 our screens?\n\nOne answer is fear, according to Jon Wortmann, executive mental coach. We fear rejection, or that our innocent social advances will be 6 as \"creepy,\". We fear we'll be 7. We fear we'll be disruptive. Strangers are inherently 8 to us, so we are more likely to feel 9 when communicating with them compared with our friends and acquaintances. To avoid this anxiety, we 10 to our phones. \"Phones become our security blanket,\" Wortmann says. \"They are our happy glasses that protect us from what we perceive is going to be more 11.\"\n\nBut once we rip off the bandaid, tuck our smartphones in our pockets and look up, it doesn't 12 so bad.

They had Chicago train commuters talk to their fellow 14. \"When Dr. Epley and Ms. Schroeder asked other people in the same train station to 15 how they would feel after talking to a stranger, the commuters thought their 16 would be more pleasant if they sat on their own,\" the New York Times summarizes.

Researchers measured people's cortisol, which is a stress marker, while they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.\n\n\n\n\"Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home,\" writes one of the researchers, Sarah Damske. In fact women even say they feel better at work, she notes. \"It is men, not women, who report being happier at home than at work.\" Another surprise is that findings hold true for both those with children and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why people who work outside the home have better health.\n\n\n\nWhat the study doesn't measure is whether people are still doing work when they're at home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home, they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace a making adjustments for working women, it's not surprising that women are more stressed at home.\n\n\n\nBut it's not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what they're supposed to be doing: working, marking money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure: Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.\n\n\n\nOn the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most of them. Your home colleagues — your family — have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it, or if they're teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they're your family. You cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.\n\n\n\nSo it's not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the tasks apparently infinite, the co-workers are much harder to motivate.\n\n\n 21.According to Paragraph 1,most previous surveys found that home ________. \n  [A] offered greater relaxation than the workplace  \n  [B] was an ideal place for stress measurement  \n  [C] generated more stress than the workplace  \n  [D] was an unrealistic place for relaxation  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. According to Damaske, who are likely to be the happiest at home? \n  [A] Childless wives  \n  [B] Working mothers  \n  [C] Childless husbands  \n  [D] Working fathers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23.The blurring of working women's roles refers to the fact that ________. \n  [A] it is difficult for them to leave their office  \n  [B] their home is also a place for kicking back  \n  [C] there is often much housework left behind  \n  [D] they are both bread winners and housewives  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24.The word\"moola\"(Line4,Para4)most probably means ________. \n  [A] skills  \n  [B] energy  \n  [C] earnings  \n  [D] nutrition  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25.The home front differs from the workplace in that ________. \n  [A] division of labor at home is seldom clear-cut  \n  [B] home is hardly a cozier working environment  \n  [C] household tasks are generally more motivating  \n  [D] family labor is often adequately rewarded  \n  \n\n\nText 2\n\nFor years, studies have found that first-generation college students — those who do not have a parent with a college degree — lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created \"a paradox\" in that recruiting first-generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has \"continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close\" ab achievement gap based on social class, according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science.\n\n\n\nBut the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach (which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap (measured by such factors as grades) between first-generation and other students.\n\n\n\nThe authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findings are based on a study involving 147 students (who completed the project) at an unnamed private university. First generation was defined as not having a parent with a four-year college degree. \n\n\n\nMost of the first-generation students (59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell Grants, a federal grant for undergraduates with financial need, while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students wit at least one parent with a four-year degree.\n\n\n\nTheir thesis — that a relatively modest intervention could have a big impact — was based on the view that first-generation students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students. They cite past research by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be narrowed to close the achievement gap.\n\n\n\nMany first-generation students \"struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education, learn the 'rules of the game,' and take advantage of college resources,\" they write. And this becomes more of a problem when collages don't talk about the class advantage and disadvantages of different groups of students. Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students 'educational experience, many first-generation students lack sight about why they are struggling and do not understand how students' like them can improve.\n\n\n 26. Recruiting more first- generation students has ________. \n  [A] reduced their dropout rates  \n  [B] narrowed the achievement gap  \n  [C] missed its original purpose  \n  [D] depressed college students  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. The author of the research article are optimistic because ________. \n  [A] the problem is solvable  \n  [B] their approach is costless  \n  [C] the recruiting rate has increased  \n  [D] their finding appeal to students  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28.

She started spinning off examples. \"If you and I parachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990, we would see much less frequent use of terms like journey, mission, passion. There were goals, there were strategies, there were objectives, but we didn't talk about energy; we didn't talk about passion.\"\n\n\n\nKoehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabulary is very \"team\"-oriented — and not by coincidence. \"Let's not forget sports — in male-dominated corporate America, it's still a big deal. It's not explicitly conscious; it's the idea that I'm a coach, and you're my team, and we're in this together. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies, but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win.\"\n\n\n\nThese terms are also intended to infuse work with meaning — and, as Khurana points out, increase allegiance to the firm. \"You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit organizations and religious organizations: Terms like vision, values, passion, and purpose,\" said Khurana.\n\n\n\nThis new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work-life balance. The \"mommy wars\" of the 1990s are still going on today, prompting arguments about why women still can't have it all and books like Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In, whose title has become a buzzword in its own right. Terms like unplug, offline, life-hack, bandwidth, and capacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home. But if your work is your \"passion,\" you'll be more likely to devote yourself to it, even if that means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed.\n\n\n\nBut this seems to be the irony of office speak: Everyone makes fun of it, but managers love it, companies depend on it, and regular people willingly absorb it. As Nunberg said, \"You can get people to think it's nonsense at the same time that you buy into it.\" In a workplace that's fundamentally indifferent to your life and its meaning, office speak can help you figure out how you relate to your work — and how your work defines who you are.\n\n\n   \n 31. According to Nancy Koehn, office language has become ________. \n  [A] more emotional  \n  [B] more objective  \n  [C] less energetic  \n  [D] less strategic  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. \"Team\"-oriented corporate vocabulary is closely related to ________. \n  [A] historical incidents  \n  [B] gender difference  \n  [C] sports culture  \n  [D] athletic executives  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. Khurana believes that the importation of terminology aims to ________. \n  [A] revive historical terms  \n  [B] promote company image  \n  [C] foster corporate cooperation  \n  [D] strengthen employee loyalty  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. It can be inferred that Lean In ________. \n  [A] voices for working women  \n  [B] appeals to passionate workaholics  \n  [C] triggers debates among mommies  \n  [D] praises motivated employees  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. Which of the following statements is true about office speak? \n  [A] Managers admire it but avoid it  \n  [B] Linguists believe it to be nonsense  \n  [C] Companies find it to be fundamental  \n  [D] Regular people mock it but accept it  \n  \n\n\n\nText 4\n\nMany people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reported for June, along with the drop in the unemployment rate to 6.1 percent, as good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is another important part of the jobs picture that was largely overlooked. There was a big jump in the number of people who repot voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000 (4.4 percent) above its year ago level.\n\n\n\nBefore explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.\n\n\n\nThere was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000 (7.9 percent) from is year ago level.\n\n\n\nWe know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The survey used by the Labor Department asks people is they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the answer is \"yes\", they are classified as worked less than 35 hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice. They are only classified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.\n\n\n\nThe issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare because one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment. For many people, especially those with serious health conditions or family members with serious health conditions, before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance.\n\n\n\nHowever, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance.\n\n\n 36. Which part of the jobs picture are neglected? \n  [A] The prospect of a thriving job market.  \n  [B] The increase of voluntary part-time market.  \n  [C] The possibility of full employment.  \n  [D] The acceleration of job creation.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. Many people work part-time because they ________. \n  [A] prefer part-time jobs to full-time jobs.  \n  [B] feel that is enough to make ends meet.  \n  [C] cannot get their hands on full-time jobs.  \n  [D] haven't seen the weakness of the market.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. Involuntary part-time employment is the US ________. \n  [A] is harder to acquire than one year ago.  \n  [B] shows a general tendency of decline.  \n  [C] satisfies the real need of the jobless.  \n  [D] is lower than before the recession.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39. It can be learned that with Obamacare, ________. \n  [A] it is no longer easy for part-timers to get insurance  \n  [B] employment is no longer a precondition to get insurance  \n  [C] it is still challenging to get insurance for family members  \n  [D] full-time employment is still essential for insurance  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 40.

We are going through life facing sad experiences. Moreover, we are grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a romantic relationship or a house. Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time, but you should remember that they won't last forever.\n\nWhen our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life. Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and happiness. I want to share these ten old truths I've learned along the way.\n\n41. _____________________________\n\nFear is both useful and harmful. This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it. Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. My favorite actor Will Smith once said, \"Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.\" I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination.\n\n42. _____________________________\n\nIf you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment. Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future. You may feel guilt over your past, but you are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change. Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive. Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see the possibilities before you. Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that can be designed into the present.\n\n43. _____________________________\n\nSometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something.\n\n44. _____________________________\n\nNo matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remember that you are not alone. Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people. You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor, help and companionship. If you have no friends or relatives, try to participate in several online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement.\n\n45. _____________________________\n\nToday many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from external sources. This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life. When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your decision is the best. You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices.\n   \n    \n   \nPart C\n\nDirections:\nIn this section there is a text in English.

It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it's easy to zone out from the actual driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.\n\nThis is the well-travelled road effect: people tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.\n\nThe effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we don't have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter.\n   \n    \nPart A\n\n51.

And new research suggests that happiness might influence 1 firm's work, too.\n\nCompanies located in places with happier people invest more, according to a recent research paper. 2, firms in happy places spend more on R&D (research and development). That's because happiness is linked to the kind of longer-term thinking 3 for making investments for the future.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if the 4 and inclination for risk-taking that come with happiness would 5 the way companies invested. So they compared U.S. cities' average happiness 6 by Gallup polling with the investment activity of publicly traded firms in those areas.\n\n7 enough, firms' investment and R&D intensity were correlated with the happiness of the area in which they were 8. But is it really happiness that's linked to investment, or could something else about happier cities 9 why firms there spend more on R&D? To find out, the researchers controlled for various 10 that might make firms more likely to invest – like size, industry, and sales – and for indicators that a place was 11 to live in, like growth in wages or population. The link between happiness and investment generally 12 even after accounting for these things.\n\nThe correlation between happiness and investment was particularly strong for younger firms, which the authors 13 to \"less codified decision making process\" and the possible presence of \"younger and less 14 managers who are more likely to be influenced by sentiment.\" The relationship was 15 stronger in places where happiness was spread more 16. Firms seem to invest more in places where most people are relatively happy, rather than in places with happiness inequality.\n\n17 this doesn't prove that happiness causes firms to invest more or to take a longer-term view, the authors believe it at least 18 at that possibility. It's not hard to imagine that local culture and sentiment would help 19 how executives think about the future. \"It surely seems plausible that happy people would be more forward-thinking and creative and 20 R&D more than the average,\" said one researcher.\n   \n\n1.

(40 points)\n\nText 1\n\nIt's true that high-school coding classes aren't essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science.\n\n\n\nHowever, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it's not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers — but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It's not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.\n\n\n\nStudents also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students away.\n\n\n\nThe Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that's become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but \"we try to gear lessons toward things they're interested in,\" said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.\n\n\n\nThe students in the Flatiron class probably won't drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the \"Ruby on Rails\" language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn — how to think logically through a problem and organize the results — apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers — in their pockets, in their offices, in their homes — for the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax the machine into producing what they want — the earlier they learn that they have the power to do that — the better.\n\n\n 21. Cortina holds that early exposure to computer science makes it easier to ________. \n  [A] complete future job training  \n  [B] remodel the way of thinking  \n  [C] formulate logical hypotheses  \n  [D] perfect artwork production  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. In delivering lessons for high-schoolers, Flatiron has considered their ________. \n  [A] experience  \n  [B] interest  \n  [C] career prospects  \n  [D] academic backgrounds  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. Deborah Seehorn believes that the skills learned at Flatiron will ________. \n  [A] help students learn other computer languages  \n  [B] have to be upgraded when new technologies come  \n  [C] need improving when students look for jobs  \n  [D] enable students to make big quick money  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. According to the last paragraph, Flatiron students are expected to ________. \n  [A] bring forth innovative computer technologies  \n  [B] stay longer in the information technology industry  \n  [C] become better prepared for the digitalized world  \n  [D] compete with a future army of programmers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. The word \"coax\" (Line4, Para.6) is closest in meaning to ________. \n  [A] persuade  \n  [B] frighten  \n  [C] misguide  \n  [D] challenge  \n  \n\n\nText 2\n\nBiologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens — a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands — once lent red to the often gray landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species' historic range.\n\n\n\nThe crash was a major reason the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) decided to formally list the bird as threatened. \"The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation,\" said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as \"endangered,\" a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats. But Ashe and others argued that the\"threatened\" tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken's habitat.\n\n\n\nUnder the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range-wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat, USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let \"states\" remain in the driver's seat for managing the species,\" Ashe said.\n\n\n\nNot everyone buys the win-win rhetoric. Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not surprisingly, doesn't go far enough. \"The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction,\" says biologist Jay Lininger.\n\n\n 26. The major reason for listing the lesser prairie as threatened is ________. \n  [A] its drastically decreased population  \n  [B] the underestimate of the grassland acreage  \n  [C] a desperate appeal from some biologists  \n  [D] the insistence of private landowners  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. The \"threatened\" tag disappointed some environmentalists in that it ________. \n  [A] was a give-in to governmental pressure  \n  [B] would involve fewer agencies in action  \n  [C] granted less federal regulatory power  \n  [D] went against conservation policies  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. It can be learned from Paragraph3 that unintentional harm-doers will not be prosecuted if they ________. \n  [A] agree to pay a sum for compensation  \n  [B] volunteer to set up an equally big habitat  \n  [C] offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job  \n  [D] promise to raise funds for USFWS operations  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. According to Ashe， the leading role in managing the species in ________. \n  [A] the federal government  \n  [B] the wildlife agencies  \n  [C] the landowners  \n  [D] the states  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. Jay Lininger would most likely support ________. \n  [A] industry groups  \n  [B] the win-win rhetoric  \n  [C] environmental groups  \n  [D] the plan under challenge  \n  \n\n\nText 3\n\nThat everyone's too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully：There's never any time to read.\n\n\n\nWhat makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don't seem sufficient. The web's full of articles offering tips on making time to read: \"Give up TV\" or \"Carry a book with you at all times.\" But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn't work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning — or else you're so exhausted that a challenging book's the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, \"is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication... It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption.\" Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can't be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.\n\n\n\nIn fact, \"becoming more efficient\" is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you'll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. \"The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,\" writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and \"we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes) as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them\". No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.\n\n\n\nSo what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You'd think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us \"step outside time's flow\" into \"soul time\". You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. \"Carry a book with you at all times\" can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you're \"making time to read,\" but just reading, and making time for everything else.\n\n\n 31. The usual time-management techniques don't work because ________. \n  [A] what they can offer does not ease the modern mind  \n  [B] what challenging books demand is repetitive reading  \n  [C] what people often forget is carrying a book with them  \n  [D] what deep reading requires cannot be guaranteed  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32.

But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.\n\n\n\nYoung people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.\n\n\n\nFrom career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.\n\n\n\nYoung and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those \"just getting started in life\" face a tougher a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.\n\n\n\nPete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-yaear-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said. \"I can't afford to pay ma monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to mark that happen.\" Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. \"I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn't have college degrees,\" Schneider said. \"I don't think people are capable of that anymore.\"\n\n\n 36. One cross-generation mark of a successful life is ________. \n  [A] trying out different lifestyles  \n  [B] having a family with children  \n  [C] working beyond retirement age  \n  [D] setting up a profitable business  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that young people tend to ________. \n  [A] favor a slower life pace  \n  [B] hold an occupation longer  \n  [C] attach importance to pre-marital finance  \n  [D] give priority to childcare outside the home  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. The priorities and expectations defined by the young will ________. \n  [A] become increasingly clear  \n  [B] focus on materialistic issues  \n  [C] depend largely on political preferences  \n  [D] reach almost all aspects of American life  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39.

He cries.When he's angry? He shouts.Scared? Probably a bit of both.As we grow up, we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don't dictate our behaviours, which is in many ways a good thing. But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing emotions, especially negative ones.that's about as effective as brushing dirt under a carpet and can even make us ill. What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and express what we feel appropriately, and then-again like children-move.\n\n42. ______________\n\nA couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was nine years old at the time, got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed, and couldn't stop talking about it. Too often we believe that a new job, bigger house or better car will be the magic silver bullet that will allow us to finally be content, but the reality is these things have very little lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day is a much better way to improve wellbeing.\n\n43. ______________\n\nHave you ever noticed how much children laugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies, increase good hormones like endorphins, improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off enfection. All of which, of course, have a positive effect on happiness levels.\n\n44. ______________\n\nThe problem with being a grown up is that there's an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with — work, mortgage payments,figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it's important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things we love. Those things might be social, sporting, creative or completely random (dancing aroud the living room,anyone?) — it doesn't matter, so long as they're enjoyable, and not likely to have negative side effects, such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you're on a tight budget.\n\n45. ______________\n\nHaving said all of the above, it's important to add that we shouldn't try too hard to be happy. Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said:\"Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.\" And in that,once more, we need to look to the example of our children, to whom happiness is not a goal but a natural by product of the way they live.\n   \n    \n   \nPart C\n\nDirections:\nTranslate the following text into Chinese.

The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you'll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you'll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,00 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally — which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.\n   \n    \nPart A\n\n51.

The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley's world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.\n\n\n\nParkrun is succeeding where London's Olympic \"legacy\" is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run — up to 2012 — but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to \"inspire a generation. \"The success of Parkrun offers answers.\n\n\n\nParkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers.\n\n\n\nIndeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally \"grassroots\", concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods — making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.\n\n\n 21. According to Paragraph1, Parkrun has ________. \n  [A] gained great popularity  \n  [B] created many jobs  \n  [C] strengthened community ties  \n  [D] become an official festival  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. The author believes that London's Olympic \"legacy\" has failed to ________. \n  [A] boost population growth  \n  [B] promote sport participation  \n  [C] improve the city's image  \n  [D] increase sport hours in schools  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. Parkrun is different from Olympic games in that it ________. \n  [A] aims at discovering talents  \n  [B] focuses on mass competition  \n  [C] does not emphasize elitism  \n  [D] does not attract first-timers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. With regard to mass sport, the author holds that governments should ________. \n  [A] organize \"grassroots\" sports events  \n  [B] supervise local sports associations  \n  [C] increase funds for sports clubs  \n  [D] invest in public sports facilities  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25.

It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.\"\n\n\n\nRadesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who sued devices during the exercise started 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.\n\n\n\nInfants are wired to look at parents' faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive — as they often are when absorbed in a device — it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the \"still face experiment\" devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother's attention. \"Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,\" says Radesky.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an \"oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting\" with their children: \"It's based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you're failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.\" Tronick believes that just because a child isn't learning from the screen doesn't mean there's no value to it — particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their child the rest of the time.\n\n\n   \n 26. According to Jenny Radesky, digital products are designed to ________. \n  [A] simplify routine matters  \n  [B] absorb user attention  \n  [C] better interpersonal relations  \n  [D] increase work efficiency  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. Radesky's food-testing exercise shows that mothers' use of devices ________. \n  [A] takes away babies' appetite  \n  [B] distracts children's attention  \n  [C] slows down babies' verbal development  \n  [D] reduces mother-child communication  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. Radesky's cites the \"still face experiment\" to show that ________. \n  [A] it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions  \n  [B] verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange  \n  [C] children are insensitive to changes in their parents' mood  \n  [D] parents need to respond to children's emotional needs  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to ________. \n  [A] protect kids from exposure to wild fantasies  \n  [B] teach their kids at least 30,000 words a year  \n  [C] ensure constant interaction with their children  \n  [D] remain concerned about kid's use of screens  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. According to Tronick, kid's use of screens may ________. \n  [A] give their parents some free time  \n  [B] make their parents more creative  \n  [C] help them with their homework  \n  [D] help them become more attentive  \n  \n\n\n\n\nText 3\n\nToday, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn't academic.\n\n\n\nBut while this may be true, it's not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated \"race to the finish line,\" whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits — in fact, it probably enhances it.\n\n\n\nStudies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes — all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders.\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn't surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on.\n\n\n   \n 31. One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a gap year is that ________. \n  [A] they think it academically misleading  \n  [B] they have a lot of fun to expect in college  \n  [C] it feels strange to do differently from others  \n  [D] it seems worthless to take off-campus courses  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32.

The word \"acclimation\"（Line 8, Para. 3） is closest in meaning to ________. \n  [A] adaptation  \n  [B] application  \n  [C] motivation  \n  [D] competition  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. A gap year may save money for students by helping them ________. \n  [A] avoid academic failures  \n  [B] establish long-term goals  \n  [C] switch to another college  \n  [D] decide on the right major  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35.

In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work — such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep — that affect the lives of all Americans.\n\n\n\nAnother nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?\n\n\n\n\"It's already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,\" he says. We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, \"Wait a minute, is this OK?\"\"Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?\"\n\n\n\nSuch a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire, researchers say.\n\n\n\nFor one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade, the focus has been on climate change — how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires.\n\n\n\nWhile climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn't come at the expense of the rest of the equation.\n\n\n\n\"The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both ways,\" he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to \"an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws, policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.\n\n\n\n\"We've disconnected ourselves from living with fire,\" Balch says. \"It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.\"\n\n\n 36. More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in 2015 they ________. \n  [A] exhausted unprecedented management efforts  \n  [B] consumed a record-high percentage of budget  \n  [C] severely damaged the ecology of western states  \n  [D] caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. Moritz calls for the use of \"a magnifying glass\" to ________. \n  [A] raise more funds for fire-prone areas  \n  [B] avoid the redirection of federal money  \n  [C] find wildfire-free parts of the landscape  \n  [D] guarantee safer spending of public funds  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that ________. \n  [A] public debates have not settled yet  \n  [B] fire-fighting conditions are improving  \n  [C] other factors should not be overlooked  \n  [D] a shift in the view of fire has taken place  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39.

Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place, other industries are recruiting them with similar or better pay.\n\nFor factory owners, it all adds up to stiff competition for workers —— and upward pressure on wages. \"They're harder to find and they have job offers,\" says Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil Spring, a family-owned firm, \"They may be coming [into the workforce], but they've been plucked by other industries that are also doing an well as manufacturing,\" Mr. Dunwell has begun bringing high school juniors to the factory so they can get exposed to its culture.\n\nAt RoMan Manufacturing, a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment that his father cofounded in 1980, Robert Roth keep a close eye on the age of his nearly 200 workers, five are retiring this year. Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years.\n\nAt a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist looks flustered by the copper coils he's trying to assemble and the arrival of two visitors. It's his first week on the job. Asked about his choice of career, he says at high school he considered medical school before switching to electrical engineering. \"I love working with tools. I love creating.\" he says.\n\nBut to win over these young workers, manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle: parents, who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression, telling them to avoid the factory. Millennials \"remember their father and mother both were laid off. They blame it on the manufacturing recession,\" says Birgit Klohs, chief executive of The Right Place, a business development agency for western Michigan.\n\nThese concerns aren't misplaced: Employment in manufacturing has fallen from 17 million in 1970 to 12 million in 2013. When the recovery began, worker shortages first appeared in the high-skilled trades. Now shortages are appearing at the mid-skill levels.\n\n\"The gap is between the jobs that take to skills and those that require a lot of skill,\" says Rob Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College. \"There're enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don't need to have much skill. It's that gap in between, and that's where the problem is.\"\n\nJulie Parks of Grand Rapids Community points to another key to luring Millennials into manufacturing: a work/life balance. While their parents were content to work long hours, young people value flexibility. \"Overtime is not attractive to this generation. They really want to live their lives,\" she says.\n\n[A] says that he switched to electrical engineering because he loves working with tools.\n\n[B] points out that there are enough people to fill the jobs that don’t need much skill.\n\n[C] points out that the US doesn’t manufacture anything anymore.\n\n[D] believes that it is important to keep a close eye on the age of his workers.\n\n[E] says that for factory owners, workers are harder to find because of stiff competition.\n\n[F] points out that a work/life balance can attract young people into manufacturing.\n\n[G] says that the manufacturing recession is to blame for the lay-off the young people's parents.\n\n41.

Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course. However, during that course I realised that I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me. Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. But, to be absolutely honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream - I knew that no one, apart from myself, could imagine me in the fashion industry at all!\n   \n    \nPart A\n\n51.

Because humans have an inherent need to 1 uncertainty, according to a recent study in Psychological Science. The new research reveals that the need to know is so strong that people will 2 to satisfy their curiosity even when it is clear the answer will 3.\n\nIn a series of four experiments, behavioral scientists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and the Wisconsin School of Business tested students' willingness to 4 themselves to unpleasant stimuli in an effort to satisfy curiosity. For one 5, each participant was shown a pile of pens that the researcher claimed were from a previous experiment. The twist? Half of the pens would 6 an electric shock when clicked.\n\nTwenty-seven students were told which pens were rigged; another twenty-seven were told only that some were electrified. 7 left alone in the room, the students who did not know which ones would shock them clicked more pens and incurred more jolts than the students who knew what would 8. Subsequent experiments replicated this effect with other stimuli, 9 the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard and photographs of disgusting insects.\n\nThe drive to 10 is deeply ingrained in humans, much the same as the basic drives 11 or shelter, says Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago, a co-author of the paper. Curiosity is often considered a good instinct—it can 12 new scientific advances, for instance—but sometimes such 13 can backfire. The insight that curiosity can drive you to do 14 things is a profound one.\n\nUnhealthy curiosity is possible to 15, however. In a final experiment, participants who were encouraged to 16 how they would feel after viewing an unpleasant picture were less likely to 17 to see such an image. These results suggest that imagining the 18 of following through on one's curiosity ahead of time can help determine 19 it is worth the endeavor. \"Thinking about long-term 20 is key to mitigating the possible negative effects of curiosity,\" Hsee says.

He is a teacher at a New Hampshire high school where learning is not something of books and tests and rote memorization, but practical, reports staff writer Stacy Teicher Khadaroo in this week's cover story. When did it become accepted wisdom that students should be able to name the 13th president of the United States but be utterly bamboozled by a busted bike chain?\n\n\n\nAs Koziatek knows, there is learning in just about everything. Nothing is necessarily gained by forcing students to learn geometry at a graffitied desk stuck with generations of discarded chewing gum. They can also learn geometry by assembling a bicycle.\n\n\n\nBut he's also found a kind of insidious prejudice. Working with your hands is seen as almost a mark of inferiority. Schools in the family of vocational education \"have that stereotype... that it's for kids who can't make it academically,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOn one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America's evolution. Manufacturing is not the economic engine that it once was. The job security that the US economy once offered to high school graduates has largely evaporated. More education is the new mantra. We want more for our kids, and rightfully so.\n\n\n\nBut the headlong push into bachelor's degrees for all — and the subtle devaluing of anything less — misses an important point: That's not the only thing the American economy needs. Yes, abachelor's degree opens moredoors. But even now, 54 percent of the jobs in the country are middle-skill job, such as construction and high-skill manufacturing. But only 44 percent of workers are adequately trained.\n\n\n\nIn other words, at a time when the working class has turned the country on its political head, frustrated that the opportunity that once defined America is vanishing, one obvious solution is staring us in the face. There is a gap in working-class jobs, but the workers who need those jobs most aren't equipped to do them. Koziatek's Manchester School of Technology High School is trying to fill that gap.\n\n\n\nKoziatek's school is wake-up call. When education becomes one-size-fits-all, it risks overlooking a nation's diversity of gifts.\n\n\n   \n 21. A broken bike chain is mentioned to show student's lack of ________. \n  [A] academic training  \n  [B] practical ability  \n  [C] pioneering spirit  \n  [D] mechanical memorizetion  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. There exists the prejudice that vocational education is for kids who ________. \n  [A] have a stereotyped mind  \n  [B] have no career motivation  \n  [C] are financially disadvantaged  \n  [D] are not academically successful  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that high school graduates ________. \n  [A] used to have more job opportunities  \n  [B] used to have big financial concerns  \n  [C] are entitled to more educational privileges  \n  [D] are reluctant to work in manufacturing  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. The headlong push into bachelors degrees for all ________. \n  [A] helps create a lot of middle-class jobs  \n  [B] may narrow the gap in working-class jobs  \n  [C] indicates the overvaluing of higher education  \n  [D] is expected to yield a better-trained wirkforce  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. The author's attitude toward Koziatek's school can be described as ________. \n  [A] tolerant  \n  [B] cautious  \n  [C] supportive  \n  [D] disappointed  \n  \n\n\n\n \nText 2\n\nWhile fossil fuels — coal, oil, gas — still generate roughly 85 percent of the world's energy supply, it's clearer than ever that the future belongs to renewable sources such as wind and solar. The move to renewable is picking up momentum around the world: They now account for more than half of new power sources going on line.\n\n\n\nSome growth stem from a commitment by governments and farsighted businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is about the plummeting prices of renewables, especially wind and solar. The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.\n\n\n\nIn many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal energy source. In Scotland, for example, wind turbines provide enough electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world takes the lead, notably China and Europe, the United States is also seeing a remarkable shift. In March, for the first time, wind and solar power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US, reported the US Energy Information Administration.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has underlined fossil fuels — especially coal — as the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa, he dismissed wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play well with many in Iowa, where wind turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state's electricity generation – and where tech giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data centers.\n\n\n\nThe question \"what happens when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't s shine?\" has provided a quick put-down for skeptics. But a boost in the storage capacity of batteries is making their ability to keep power flowing around the clock more likely.\n\n\n\nThe advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers, who are placing big bets on battery-powered vehicles. Although electric cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could change the picture rapidly in coming years.\n\n\n\nWhile there's a long way to go, the trend lines for renewables are spiking. The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up — perhaps just in time to have a meaningful effect in showing climate change. What Washington does — or doesn't do — to promote alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in thought.\n\n\n 26. The word \"plummeting\" (Line 3, Para.2) is closest in meaning to ________. \n  [A] stabilizing  \n  [B] changing  \n  [C] falling  \n  [D] rising  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27. According to Paragraph 3, the use of renewable energy in America ________. \n  [A] is progressing notably  \n  [B] is as extensive as in Europe  \n  [C] faces many challenges  \n  [D] has proved to be impractical  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28. It can be learned that in Iowa, ________. \n  [A] wind is a widely used energy source.  \n  [B] wind energy has replaced fossil fuels  \n  [C] tech giants are investing in clean energy  \n  [D] there is a shortage of clean energy supply  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29. Which of the following is true about clean energy according to Paragraphs 5 & 6? \n  [A] Its application has boosted battery storage.  \n  [B] It is commonly used in car manufacturing.  \n  [C] Its continuous supply is becoming a reality.  \n  [D] Its sustainable exploitation will remain difficult.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that renewable energy ________. \n  [A] will bring the US closer to other countries  \n  [B] will accelerate global environmental change  \n  [C] is not really encouraged by the US government  \n  [D] is not competitive enough with regard to its cost  \n  \n\n\nText 3\n\nThe power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is astonishing — Amazon has just announced the purchase of the upmarket grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.5bn, but two years ago Facebook paid even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service, which doesn't have any physical product at all. What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely detailed web of its users' friendships and social lives.\n\n\n\nFacebook promised the European commission then that it would not link phone numbers to Facebook identities, but it broke the promise almost as soon as the deal went through. Even without knowing what was in the messages, the knowledge of who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be. What political journalist, what party whip, would not want to know the makeup of the WhatsApp groups in which Theresa May's enemies are currently plotting? It may be that the value to Amazon is not so much the 460 shops it owns, but the records of which customers have purchased what.\n\n\n\nCompetition law appears to be the only way to address these imbalances of power. But it is clumsy. For one thing, it is very slow compared to the pace of change within the digital economy. By the time a problem has been addressed and remedied it may have vanished in the marketplace, to be replaced by new abuses of power. But there is a deeper conceptual problem, too. Competition law as presently interpreted deals with financial disadvantage to consumers and this is not obvious when the users of these services don't pay for them. The users of their services are not their customers. That would be the people who buy advertising from them — and Facebook and Google, the two virtual giants, dominate digital advertising to the disadvantage of all other media and entertainment companies.\n\n\n\nThe product they're selling is data, and we, the users, convert our lives to data for the benefit of the digital giants. Just as some ants farm the bugs called aphids for the honeydew they produce when they feed, so Google farms us for the data that our digital lives yield. Ants keep predatory insects away from where their aphids feed; Gmail keeps the spammers out of our inboxes. It doesn't feel like a human or democratic relationship, even if both sides benefit.\n\n\n 31. According to Paragraph1, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for its ________. \n  [A] digital products  \n  [B] user information  \n  [C] physical assets  \n  [D] quality service  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. Linking phone numbers to Facebook identities may ________. \n  [A] worsen political disputes  \n  [B] mess up customer records  \n  [C] pose a risk to Facebook users  \n  [D] mislead the European commission  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. According to the author, competition law ________. \n  [A] should serve the new market powers  \n  [B] may worsen the economic imbalance  \n  [C] should not provide just one legal solution  \n  [D] cannot keep pace with the changing market  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. Competition law as presently interpreted can hardly protect Facebook users because ________. \n  [A] they are not defined as customers  \n  [B] they are not financially reliable  \n  [C] the services are generally digital  \n  [D] the services are paid for by advertisers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. The ants analogy is used to illustrate ________. \n  [A] a win- win business model between digital giants  \n  [B] a typical competition pattern among digital giants  \n  [C] the benefits provided for digital giants' customers  \n  [D] the relationship between digital giants and their users  \n  \n\n\nText 4\n\nTo combat the trap of putting a premium on being busy, Gal Newport, anther of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Districted world, recommends building a habit of \"deep work\" — the ability to focus without distraction.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of approaches to mastering the mastering the art of deep work — be it lengthy retreats, dedicated to a specific task;developing a daily ritual; or taking a \"journalistic\" approach to seizing moments of deep work when you can throughout the day. Whichever approach, the key is to determine your length of focus time and stick to it.\n\n\n\nNewport also recommends \"deep scheduling\" to combat constant interruptions and get more down in less time. At any given point, Ishold has deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar I protect this time like, I would a doctor's appointment or important meeting ,he writes.\n\n\n\nAnother approach to getting more down in less time is to rethink how you prioritize your day — in particular how we craft our to-do lists. Tim Harford, author of Messy. The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives, points to a study in the early 1980s, that divided undergraduates into two groups: some were advised to set out monthly goals and study activities; others were told to plan activities and golds in much time detail day by day.\n\n\n\nWhile the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Hartford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to- do list ineffective, while living room for improvisation in such a list canreap the best results.\n\n\n\nIn order to make the most of our focus and energy. We also need to embrace downtime, or as Newport suggests, \" be lazy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is indispensable to be brain as Vitamin D is to the body… [idleness] is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done,\" he argues.\n\n\n\nSriri Pillay an assistant of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes this counter-intuitive link between downtime and productivity may be due to the way our brains operate. When our brains switch between being focused and unfocused on a task, they tend to be more efficient.\n\n\n\n\"What people don't realise is that, in order to complete these tasks they need to use both the focus and unfocus circuits in their brain\", says Pillay.\n\n\n   \n 36. The key to mastering the art of deep work is to ________. \n  [A] keep to your focus time  \n  [B] list your immediate tasks  \n  [C] make specific daily plans  \n  [D] seize every minute to work  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. The study in the early 1980s cited by Harvard shows that ________. \n  [A] distractions may actually increase efficiency  \n  [B] daily schedules are indispensable to studying  \n  [C] students are hardly motivated by monthly goals  \n  [D] detailed plans many not be as fruitful as expected  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. According to Newport, idleness is ________. \n  [A] a desirable mental state for busy people  \n  [B] a major contributor to physical health  \n  [C] an effective way to save time and energy  \n  [D] an essential factor in accomplishing any work.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39. Pillay believes that our brains' shift between being focused and unfocused ________. \n  [A] can result in .Psychological will-being  \n  [B] can bring about greater efficiency  \n  [C] is aimed at a better balance in work  \n  [D] is driven by task urgency  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 40.

Simply starting a conversation with them will form a link.\n\nHere are five simple ways that you can make the first move and start a conversation with strangers.\n\n41. ____________________\n\nSuppose you are in a room with someone you don't know and something within you says \"I want to talk with this person\" —— this is something the mostly happens with all of us. You wanted to say something —— the first word —— but it just won't come out. It feels like it is stuck somewhere, I know the feelings and here is my advice just get it out.\n\nJust think: that is the worst that could happen? They won't talk with you? Well, they are not talking with you now!\n\nI truly believe that once you get that first word out everything else will just flow. So keep it simple: \"Hi\", \"Hey\" or \"Hello\"—— do the best you can to gather all of the enthusiasm and energy you can, put on a big smile and say \"Hi\".\n\n42. ____________________\n\nIt's a problem all of us face: you have limited time with the person that you want to talk with and you want to make this talk, memorable.\n\nHonestly, if we got stuck, in the rut, of \"hi\", \"hello\", \"how are you\" \"and what's going on?\" you will fail to give the initial Jolt to the conversation that can make it so memorable.\n\nSo don't be afraid, to ask more personal questions. Trust me, you'll be surprised to see how much people are willing to share if you just ask.\n\n43. ____________________\n\nWhen you meet a person for the first time, make an effort to find the things which you and that person, have in common so that you can build the conversation, from that point. When you start a conversation from there and then move outward, you will find all of a sudden that the conversation becomes a lot easier.\n\n44. ____________________\n\nImagine you are pouring your heart out to someone and they are just busy on their phone, and if you ask, for their attention, you get the response \"I can Multitask\".\n\nSo when someone tries, to communicate with you, just be in that communication wholeheartedly. Make eye contact, you can feel the conversation.\n\n45. ____________________\n\nYou all came into a conversation, where you first met the person, but after some time you may have met again, and have forgotten their name. Isn't that awkward!\n\nSo remember the little details of the people you might, or you talked with; perhaps the places they have been to, the place they want to go, the things they like, the thing they hate - whatever you talk about\n\nWhen you remember such thing you can automatically become investor in their wellbeing. So they feel a responsibility to you to keep bad relationship going\n\nThat's it. Five amazing ways that you can make conversation with almost anyone.

As for me, weighing myself every day caused me to shift my focus from being generally healthy and physically active to focusing 3 on the scale. That was bad to my overall fitness goals. I had gained weight in the form of muscle mass, but thinking only of 4 the number on the scale, I altered my training program. That conflicted with how I needed to train to 5 my goals. I also found that weighing myself daily did not provide an accurate 6 of the hard work and progress I was making in the gym. It takes about three weeks to a month to notice any significant changes in weight 7 altering your training program. The most 8 changes will be observed in skill level, strength and inches lost. For these 9 , I stopped weighing myself every day and switched to a bimonthly weighing schedule 10 . Since weight loss is not my goal, it is less important for me to 11 my weight each week. Weighing every other week allows me to observe and 12 any significant weight changes. That tells me whether I need to 13 my training program. I use my bimonthly weigh-in 14 to get information about my nutrition as well. If my training intensity remains the same, but I'm constantly 15 and dropping weight, this is a 16 that I need to increase my daily caloric intake. The 17 to stop weighing myself every day has done wonders for my overall health, fitness and well-being. I'm experiencing increased zeal for working out since I no longer carry the burden of a 18 morning weigh-in. I've also experienced greater success in achieving my specific fitness goals, 19 I'm training according to those goals, not the numbers on a scale. Rather than 20 over the scale, turn your focus to how you look, feel, how your clothes fit and your overall energy level.\n   \n\n1.

Children aren't born knowing how to say \"I'm sorry\"; rather, they learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends — and their own consciences. This is why researchers generally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing. \n\nIn the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable — it's the emotional equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. \"There has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve,\" says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researcher at the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren't binary — feelings that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive. \n\nAnd guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue. \n\nViewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing Some Kids who are low in sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice versa: High sympathy can substitute for low guilt. \n\nIn a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children Using caregiver assessments and the children's self-observations, she rated each child's overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after moral transgressions. Then the kids were handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to shared them with an anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared appeared to turn on how inclined they were to feel guilty. The guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn't magically become more sympathetic to the other child's deprivation. \n\n\"That's good news,\" Malti says. \"We can be prosocial because we caused harm and we feel regret.\"\n   \n 21. Researchers think that guilt can be a good thing because it may help ________. \n  [A] regulate a child's basic emotions  \n  [B] improve a child's intellectual ability  \n  [C] foster a child's moral development  \n  [D] intensify a child's positive feelings  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 22. According to Paragraph 2, many people still consider guilt to be ________. \n  [A] deceptive  \n  [B] burdensome  \n  [C] addictive  \n  [D] inexcusable  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 23. Vaish holds that the rethinking about guilt comes from an awareness that ________. \n  [A] emotions are context-independent  \n  [B] emotions are socially constructive  \n  [C] emotional stability can benefit health  \n  [D] an emotion can play opposing roles  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 24. Malti and others have shown that cooperation and sharing ________. \n  [A] may help correct emotional deficiencies  \n  [B] can result form either sympathy or guilt  \n  [C] can bring about emotional satisfaction  \n  [D] may be the outcome of impulsive acts  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 25. The word \"transgressions\" (Line 4, Para. 5) is closest in meaning to ________. \n  [A] teachings  \n  [B] discussions  \n  [C] restrictions  \n  [D] wrongdoings  \n  \n\n\nText 2\n\nForests give us shade, quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to do so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb. \n\nThankfully, there is a way out of this trap-but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as valuable \"carbon sinks\" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to sequester carbon now. California is leading the way, as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details. \n\nThe state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest, including by controlled burning. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees draw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to pull carbon from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable. Even in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed. \n\nThe need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and insects have killed over 100 million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres. \n\nCalifornia's plans treat 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030 — financed from the proceeds of the state's emissions — permit auctions. That's only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a million acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought. \n\nThe strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on transportation biofuels is already under way. \n\nState governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon. Califormia's plan, which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year, should serve as a model.\n   \n 26.By saying \"one of the harder challenges,\" the author implies that ________. \n  [A] global climate change may get out of control  \n  [B] people may misunderstand global warming  \n  [C] extreme weather conditions may arise  \n  [D] forests may become a potential threat  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 27.To maintain forests as valuable \"carbon sinks,\" we may need to ________. \n  [A] preserve the diversity of species in them  \n  [B] accelerate the growth of young trees  \n  [C] strike a balance among different plants  \n  [D] lower their present carbon-absorbing capacity  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 28.California's Forest Carbon Plan endeavors to ________. \n  [A] cultivate more drought-resistant trees  \n  [B] reduce the density of some of its forests  \n  [C] find more effective ways to kill insects  \n  [D] restore its forests quickly after wildfires  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 29.What is essential to California's plan according to Paragraph 5?  \n  [A] To handle the areas in serious danger first.  \n  [B] To carry it out before the year of 2020.  \n  [C] To perfect the emissions-permit auctions.  \n  [D] To obtain enough financial support.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 30.The author's attitude to California's plan can best be described as ________.  \n  [A] ambiguous  \n  [B] tolerant  \n  [C] supportive  \n  [D] cautious  \n  \n\n\n\n\nText 3\n\nAmerican farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years now.Given a multi- year decline in illegal immigration, and a similarly sustained pickup in the U.S. job market, the complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for farm workers. \n\nEfforts to crate a more straightforward agricultural-workers visa that would enable foreign workers to stay longer in the U.S. and change jobs within the industry have so far failed in Congress. If this doesn't change, American businesses, communities and consumers will be the losers. \n\nPerhaps half of U.S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the U.S., the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today's farm laborers, while still predominantly born in Mexico, are more likely to be settled, rather than migrating, and more likely to be married than single. They are also aging. At the start of this century, about one-third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now, more than half are. And crop picking is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it has been all along: Native U.S. workers won't be returning to the farm. \n\nMechanization is not the answer either—not yet at least. Production of com,cotton, rice, soybeans and wheat has been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries, need labor. Even dairy farms,where robots do a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they are automated. \n\nAs a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps in the agricultural workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply; from 2011 to 2016 the number of visas issued more than doubled. \n\nThe H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work, which is limited to 66,000 annually. Even so, employers frequently complain they aren't allotted all the workers they need. The process is cumbersome, expensive and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led H-2A worker to arrive on the job an average of 22 days late. And the shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids, which remove some workers and drive others underground. \n\nIn a 2012 survey, 71 percent of tree-fruit growers and nearly 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor. Some western growers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998-2000, 14.5 percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imported fruit had increased to 25.8 percent. \n\nIn effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.\n   \n    \n 31. What problem should be addressed according to the first two paragraphs?  \n  [A] Discrimination against foreign workers in the U.S.  \n  [B] Biased laws in favor of some American businesses.  \n  [C] Flaws in U.S. immigration rules for farm workers.  \n  [D] Decline of job opportunities in U.S. agriculture.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 32. One trouble with U.S. agricultural workforce is ________. \n  [A] the rising number of illegal immigrants  \n  [B] the high mobility of crop workers  \n  [C] the lack of experienced laborers  \n  [D] the aging of immigrant farm workers  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 33. What is the much-argued solution to the labor shortage in U.S. farming?  \n  [A] To attract younger laborers to farm work.  \n  [B] To get native U.S. workers back to farming.  \n  [C] To use more robots to grow high-value crops.  \n  [D] To strengthen financial support for farmers.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 34. Agricultural employers complain about the H-2A visa for its ________. \n  [A] slow granting procedures  \n  [B] limit on duration of stay  \n  [C] tightened requirements  \n  [D] control of annual admissions  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 35. Which of the following could be the best title for this text?  \n  [A] U.S. Agriculture in Decline?  \n  [B] Import Food or Labor?  \n  [C] America Saved by Mexico?  \n  [D] Manpower vs. Automation?  \n  \n\n\n\nText 4\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Dia Mirza and Adrian Grenier have a message for you: It's easy to beat plastic. They're part of a bunch of celebrities staring in a new video for World Environment Day — encouraging you, the consumer, to swap out your single-use plastic staples like straws and cutlery to combat the plastic crisis. \n\nThe key messages that have been put together for World Environment Day do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single-us plastics. But the overarching message is directed at individuals. \n\nMy concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved. On their own, taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws, for example, will accomplish little and require very little of us. They could even be detrimental, satisfying a need to have \"done our bit\" without ever progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions — a kind of \"moral licensing\" that allays our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more of those in charge. \n\nWhile the conversation around our environment and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws, we're ignoring the balance of power that implies that as \"consumers\" we must shop sustainably, rather than as \"citizens\" hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that the environment isn't everyone's priority - or even most people's. We shouldn't expect it to be. In her latest book, Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things, Wellesley College professor Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for the change to be structural. \n\nThis might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action, or banning single-use plastics altogether. India has just announced it will \"eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022.\" There are also incentive-based ways of making better environmental choices easier, such as ensuring recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal. \n\nDeSombre isn't saying people should stop caring about the environment. It's just that individual actions are too slow, she says, for that to be the only, or even primary, approach to changing widespread behavior. \n\nNone of this is about writing off the individual. It's just about putting things into perspective. We don't have time to wait. We need progressive policies that shape collective action (and rein in polluting businesses), alongside engaged citizens pushing for change. \n   \n 36. Some celebrities star in a new video to ________.  \n  [A] demand new laws on the use of plastics  \n  [B] urge consumers to cut the use of plastics  \n  [C] invite public opinion on the plastics crisis  \n  [D] disc lose the causes of the plastics crisis  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 37. The author is concerned that \"moral licensing\" may ________.  \n  [A] mislead us into doing worthless things  \n  [B] prevent us from making further efforts  \n  [C] weaken our sense of accomplishment  \n  [D] suppress our desire for success  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 38. By pointing out our identity as \"citizens,\",the author indicates that ________. \n  [A] our focus should be shifted shifted to community welfare  \n  [B] our relationship with local industries is improving  \n  [C] We have been actively exercising our civil rights  \n  [D] We should press our government to lead the combat  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 39. DeSombre argues that the best way for a collective change should be ________.  \n  [A] a win-win arrangement  \n  [B] a self-driven mechanism  \n  [C] a cost-effective approach  \n  [D] a top down process  \n  \n\n\n\n \n 40. The author concludes that individual efforts ________. \n  [A] can be too aggressive  \n  [B] can be too inconsistent  \n  [C] are far from sufficient  \n  [D] are far from rational  \n  \n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\nDirections:\nRead the following text and answer the questions by choosing the most suitable subheading from the list A-G for each of the numbered paragraphs (41-45).

And placing too much emphasis on their opinions can ruin a fantastic home purchase. \n\n\"Speaking with your children before you make a real estate decision is wise, but I wouldn't base the purchasing decision solely on their opinions.\" Hampson said. \n\nThe other issue is that many children — especially older ones — may base their real estate knowledge on HGTV shows, said Aaron Norris of The Norris Group in Riverside , Calif . \n\n\"They love Chip and Joanna Gaines just as much as the rest of us,\" he said. \"HGTV has seriously changed how people view real estate. It's not shelter , it's a lifestyle. With that mindset change come some serious money consequences.\" \n\nKids tend to get stuck in the features and the immediate benefits to them personally, Norris said. \n\nParents need to remind their children that their needs and desires may change over time, said Julie Gurner, a real estate analyst with FitSmallBusiness.com. \n\n\"Their opinions can change tomorrow,\" Gurner said. \"Harsh as it may be to say, that decision should likely not be made contingent on a child's opinions, but rather made for them with great consideration into what home can meet their needs best - and give them an opportunity to customize it a bit and make it their own.\" \n\nThis advice is more relevant now than ever before, even as more parents want to embrace the ideas of their children, despite the current housing crunch.\n\n[A] remarks that significant moves may pose challenges to children.\n\n[B] says that it is wise to leave kids in the dark about real estate decisions.\n\n[C] advises that home purchases should not be based only on children's opinions.\n\n[D] thinks that children should be given a sense of involvement in homebuying decisions.\n\n[E] notes that aspects like children's friends and social activities should be considered upon homebuying.\n\n[F] believes that homebuying decisions should be based on children's needs rather than their opinions.\n\n[G] assumes that many children's views on real estate are influenced by the media.\n\n41.

James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it, \"having a go at the writing game\". While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world was the result of years of practicing, re-writing and reading.
